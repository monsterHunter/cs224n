You know what I do is write for kids, and in fact, I'm probably the author for the kids, you read in the United States.
And I always tell people that I don't want a scientist.
I can <unk> like farmer, or with leather stores, and never nobody has chosen a farmer.
I'm here to talk to you today about circles and <unk>
And you know that a <unk> is generally something that fell somewhere there.
You just have to turn back to the apple to see it as a <unk>
That's the painting of a circle.
A friend of mine did that -- Richard <unk>
It's the kind of complicated circle that I'm going to talk about.
My circle started in the middle of the middle school, in <unk> Ohio where I was the rare of the class.
When I was beating every week in the bathroom every week until a teacher saved my life.
She saved my life by letting me go into the bathroom of the teachers.
I did it in secret.
for three years.
And I had to go from the city.
He had a thumb, and 85 dollars, and I ended up in San Francisco, and I found a lover -- and in the <unk> I felt the need to begin to work in organizations who were fighting against AIDS.
About three or four years ago, at half the night I received a phone call from that teacher who said, "I need to see you.
I'm <unk> that adults never come to us.
You could go to Ohio and please bring that guy to that guy that you know you've already found.
And I must tell you that I have <unk> cancer, and I'd like you to ask you with this please."
Well, the next day we were in <unk>
We went to see, we got <unk> and we realized that she needed to be <unk>
We found a place, the <unk> and the take care of her family, because it was necessary,
It's something we knew how to do.
And as the woman who I wanted to <unk> as an adult came to <unk> became a box <unk> and it was put in my hands.
And what happened was that the circle had closed, it had become a circle -- and that epiphany that I talked to you was made in itself.
<unk> is that death is part of life.
She saved my life, my partner and I save her one of it.
And you know that that part of life needs all the rest of life.
It needs truth and beauty, and I'm very happy that I was talking about a lot of this.
It also needs -- needs dignity, love and pleasure. And it's our work to provide those things.
Thank you.
As an artist, the connection is very important to me.
Through my work, I'm trying to express that humans are not separated from nature and everything is interconnected.
I went for the first time to Antarctica about 10 years ago, and I saw my first <unk>
I was amazed.
My heart can quickly, I was <unk> trying to understand what was in front of me.
I put them all around my water <unk> almost 60 feet -- and I couldn't think that it was a <unk> on another <unk> on another snow after year.
<unk> are born when we fall from the glaciers or break the barriers of ice.
Each iceberg has its own individual personality.
They have a different way of interacting with their environment and their experiences.
Some people refuse to <unk> and they hold up to the end, whereas others can't afford it, and they become a <unk> <unk> <unk>
It's easy to think, when you see a <unk> that they're isolated apart and by alone, in a large measure as we see us sometimes as humans.
But the reality is the opposite.
As a <unk> melts, I'm breathing their ancestral atmosphere.
As an iceberg melts, it releases freshwater rich that feeds many forms of life.
I walk up to photograph these <unk> as if it was about the portraits of my ancestors, by knowing that in these unique moments there are that way and will not exist in that way again.
It's not the death when it's <unk> it's not an end, but a continuation of their path through the life cycle.
Part of the <unk> ice that I photograph is very <unk> it has a couple of thousands of years.
And another part of the ice has over 100,000 years.
The last few pictures I'd like to show you is from an iceberg I photographed on <unk> Greenland.
It's unlikely to actually witness an iceberg <unk>
Here they have.
You can see the left a little boat.
It's about five meters.
And I'd like you to pay attention to the shape of iceberg and your line of <unk>
You can see here, starts to <unk> the boat has moved to the other side, and the man is standing there.
This is a <unk> iceberg than average size.
<unk> about 120 feet or 40 meters.
This video is in real time.
And so <unk> the iceberg shows a different side of his personality.
Thank you.
I want you to imagine two couples in 1979, the same day, exactly at the same time, every single baby.
So two couples each one with a baby.
I don't want you to feel too much about the details of conception, because if they stop thinking about it, they won't pay attention.
Let's think about that for a moment.
And on this stage I want you to imagine that, in a case, the chromosome and of the sperm is joined by the X chromosome.
And in the other case, the X chromosome from the sperm is joined by the X chromosome.
Both of these, and it starts life.
We'll go back to talk about them later.
In my activity on the ground to get two roles.
In one of my roles with the history of anatomy.
I'm a <unk> training and what I study in this case is the way people started the anatomy of the anatomy of human bodies, and <unk> how they have considered body fluids the idea of <unk> what have you thought about the body.
The other role in my work is an activist, like <unk> of patients or, as I say sometimes, <unk> to people who are medical patients.
In this case, I've worked with people whose physical features challenge social norms.
I've been working on, for example, with twins.
I've worked with people with <unk> people who are much lower than the average.
And I've worked with a lot of cases of people with <unk> sex, individuals whose physical typology didn't fit into the male and female <unk>
In general, we can <unk> <unk>
The <unk> has a lot of shapes.
I'm going to give you some examples of ways to have sex that won't be <unk> in the common forms of male or female.
For instance, there is the case of the individual with <unk> <unk> which is the <unk> gene <unk> which says to the <unk> that we all have in the life that we all have <unk>
And then, in the <unk> life, the testicles make testosterone.
But because this individual lacks testosterone, the body doesn't react to itself.
It's <unk> syndrome to <unk>
So there's high school levels but no reaction.
As a consequence, the body develops following a course typically female.
When you <unk> the baby is <unk>
It's a girl. It's raised as a child.
And often, it's not until puberty, when it's growing and developing the breast but it doesn't have the menstrual period, when someone realizes that something is happening.
After doing this, they realize that instead of having <unk> and <unk> actually has <unk> and <unk>
The important thing to understand is that you can think it's a man, but it's actually not that way.
Women, like men, we have in the body something called <unk> <unk>
They're in the back of the body.
<unk> glands produce <unk> the hormone <unk>
Most of the women as I -- I consider a <unk> woman, not knowing her <unk> structure, I think it's a typical woman most of women like me who are sensitive to <unk>
<unk> <unk> and we respond to the <unk>
As a consequence, someone like me has the most exposed brain to the <unk> that the woman who was born with <unk> who has <unk>
So sex is something complicated. It's not that the <unk> are in the middle of the <unk> in a certain way can be everywhere.
Another example: a few years ago, I got a call from a 19-year-old <unk> born and raised as <unk> had girlfriend, and sexual relationships with her, he had a life as a boy and had just found out he had <unk> and a <unk>
He had an extreme way of a disease known as <unk> <unk> <unk>
He had 20th chromosomes and the uterus -- the <unk> glands were so active that, in essence, creating a male hormone environment.
As a result, the genitals were <unk> their brain was exposed to the hormone component typically men.
He was born with <unk> nobody <unk> anything.
And it was at the age of 19, when he started having medical problems caused by the internal <unk> when the doctors discovered that, in fact, was women inside.
Well, another quick example of a case of <unk>
Some people with 20th chromosomes develop what's known as <unk> -- they have tissue tissue wrapped up in <unk> tissue.
We don't know what happens.
So, there are many varieties of sex.
The reason that children with these kinds of bodies are going to be <unk> twin twins or <unk> <unk> surgery -- is not to be able to enjoy a better physical health for it.
In many cases, people are perfectly healthy.
The reason why it comes to various surgeries is that they are a threat to our social categories.
The system is based on the idea that one particular anatomy is bringing together a particular identity.
We have the idea that being woman is to have a <unk> identity -- it's going to be a black identity -- it means having an African anatomy in historical terms.
A very simplistic idea.
And when you show us a body that shows something quite different, we have problems with <unk>
So we have very strong ideas in our culture about <unk>
Our nation is based on a very romantic concept concept.
Imagine the amazing thing that is having children that are born like two people in one body.
The most high case more high is last year with <unk> South African <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> their sex in the <unk> <unk>
A lot of journalists called them to wonder: "What do you do the exam to do to determine whether or <unk> is man or <unk>
And I had to tell you the reporters that we don't have such a test.
In fact, we know that sex is so complicated that we have to admit that nature doesn't plot a <unk> line between men and women or between men and <unk> and women and <unk> are us who map that line.
So what we have is a situation where the more of science, the more we need to admit that these categories -- we thought were <unk> categories of stable categories that are used directly with <unk> categories.
And not just in terms of sex.
It's also in terms of race, something that turns out much more complicated than the terminology of <unk>
As we see, we go into a rough terrain.
<unk> for example, the fact that we share at least 95 percent of the DNA with chimpanzees.
What are we <unk> in the fact of the <unk> of them in just a few <unk>
And as we get into science we get more and more in a uncomfortable zone that we need to recognize that <unk> categories are probably too <unk>
And we're looking at this in all walks of human life.
One of them, for example, in our current culture, in the United States today, are the struggles to the beginning and the end of life.
It's hard to set up a moment from which a body becomes human and has different rights to the <unk>
There are very <unk> discussions today -- not in public, but I know within the <unk> about when someone is considered killed.
Our ancestors never had to deal with this question of whether someone was dead.
As a lot he would put her up a pen in front of the nose, and if he moved it off, still not <unk>
So if I stopped moving it up.
But today, we can, for example, extract vital organs from a body and put them in another body.
And as a result, we have to deal with a prisoner's dilemma to truly somebody's death, and this is puts us into a difficult situation where we don't have the simple categories of the past.
And maybe think that this explosion of categories might be celebrating somebody like me.
In politics I'm a liberal, I claim to people with the unusual bodies, but I have to admit that I gets nerve nervous.
We will argue that these categories are much more fragile than we ever thought about it.
It was from the point of view of the concept of democracy.
And to tell you about this tension -- I have to admit that I'm a fervent fan of the <unk> <unk>
I know they were <unk> I know they were <unk> but they were big.
I mean, they were so brave and audacious and so radical and so radical what they did, that I find every single time looking at that musical <unk> <unk> and not by the music, which is totally <unk>
That's what happened in <unk> with the <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> were, for me, the first activists of the anatomy and explain why.
What they <unk> was a <unk> concept, and we had it with another which was radical and beautiful and stayed for 200 years.
And as everybody remember, what our <unk> <unk> was the idea of <unk> the monarchy was based on a very simplistic concept of anatomy.
The monarchs in the old world didn't know the DNA, but they had clear the idea of birth to birth.
They had the concept of blue blood.
They were from the idea that the political power came up with the <unk> of the <unk> the father and then to son, etc.
<unk> <unk> rejected that idea and replacing it for a new <unk> concept, and that concept was that all men are created equal.
They took the game field and decided that the anatomy that mattered was the anatomy in common and not <unk> differences, that was very radical.
And in part of it they were doing because they formed part of a <unk> system where two things were <unk>
I was overwhelmed with democracy and at the same time we had science.
And there is really clear, if you look at the story of the <unk> <unk> that many were very interested in science and the idea of a <unk> world.
They were <unk> from the explanations -- and therefore we <unk> the concept of power -- transmitted by a vague idea of birth <unk>
They were moving towards a <unk> concept.
And if you look, for example, the Declaration of <unk> talk about nature and the god of nature.
They don't talk about God and the nature of God.
They talk about the power of nature to tell us who we are.
And in consequence they were broadcasting the idea of <unk> <unk>
And in doing so, they were <unk> the foundations of the future Rights movement.
They didn't think of that way, but they did it for us and it was great.
And what happened years next?
And women <unk>
Then the success of the Civil Rights movement with people from the <unk> <unk> <unk> who said, "I'm not a <unk>
We found men in the rows of the Civil Rights movement, saying, "I'm a man."
And again, people of color that were <unk> to <unk> <unk> about the <unk> difference, and again, <unk>
We see the same with the Movement of <unk>
The problem is, of course, as we look at <unk> we need to start asking why we keep certain <unk>
But attention, I want to keep <unk> in our culture.
For instance, I don't want to give a fish the same rights to a human.
I don't want to say that we had to go to anatomy.
I don't mean the age of five years should be allowed to have sex or get married.
There are some <unk> that for me, they make sense and I think we should be <unk>
But the challenge is trying to figure out what they are, why keep them and if they make sense.
Well, let's go back to those two beings -- the beginning of this talk.
We have two <unk> both <unk> in the middle of 1979 exactly the same day.
Imagine that one of them, Mary, was born three months before time: June 1, 1980.
Henry, on the contrary, was born in term, the March March was born.
For the fact that we were born three months before Mary is attributed all the rights three months to Henry -- the right to Henry sexual consent, the right to vote, the right to <unk>
Henry has to wait for all of that not because it has a different age, but because he was born after.
We found other <unk> in relation to their rights.
Henry, at virtue of being considered -- if I don't tell you if it's <unk> in virtue of being considered to be considered to be considered to be considered from the guaranteed <unk> that Mary doesn't worry about.
Mary, thank you the same rights for marriage that Henry in every states, for example.
Henry can marry all of the states with a woman, but Mary can marry a woman only in some states.
So even <unk> <unk> categories that in various ways are <unk> and <unk>
And now the question is, what do we do now that science went on, so much in the field of the anatomy we get to the point of having to admit that a democracy based on anatomy could be <unk>
I don't want to give up the science, but at the same time sometimes I feel like science <unk>
Where are we <unk>
It seems that what happens in our culture is sort of a <unk> attitude attitude attitude -- "Well, we need to draw the line somewhere, so we're going to do."
But a lot of people have caught up in a strange position.
For example, Texas at a moment has decided that to marry a man you don't have to have Y chromosome, and to marry a woman you've got to have Y chromosome.
Now, in practice they don't make tests and <unk>
But this is also very strange given the story that I told the principle of <unk> syndrome to <unk>
If we look at one of the founding parents of modern democracy, Dr. Martin Luther King, in his speech, "I think <unk> offers a solution.
He says that we should judge people <unk> not in their skin, but on the content of their <unk> going beyond anatomy.
And I want to say, "Yes, the idea looks pretty good.
But in practice, how do you do it?
How do people judge people based on the content of their <unk>
I want to point out also that I'm not sure we should be able to focus on this to give you rights to people, because I have to admit that I know some <unk> <unk> who probably deserve more social services than some humans I know.
I also want to say that maybe some of the <unk> that I know can make more intelligent and smart <unk> about their sexual relationships that people from 40 to be <unk>
So how do you put the theme of the content of <unk>
It's very hard.
And one part of me asks what would happen if the character of a person could be measured with an instrument, maybe with an MRI machine.
Do we really want to get at that point?
I'm not sure where we go.
What I know is that it seems to be very important that the United States is still driving this current thinking of thinking about democracy.
We've done a good job in defense of democracy and I think we'll do a good job in the future.
We don't live, for example, in a context as Iranian where a man who feels attracted to other men is susceptible to being killed, unless they're willing to submit to a change of sex, in which case it is being allowed to live.
We're not in that situation.
I'm glad to say that we don't have a context as a surgeon that I had been talking about a couple years ago that I had made a couple of years ago that I had done to give birth twin and then pick them up and then pick it up his fame.
But when the phone asked him the reason for the <unk> operation, a very <unk> operation, responded to me that in that other country these kids would be very <unk> and therefore I had to do it.
I said, "Well, it's considered the political musician rather than the separation <unk>
The United States offers huge possibilities to people who are <unk> to change the sake of the state.
So I think we have to be on the head.
Well, to end I mean I've been talking a lot about <unk>
And I want to think about what the democracy would be for democracy, or as it might have been, if we were given more participation to <unk>
And I want to say something a little radical for a <unk> and that is that I think there may be different ideas coming from different <unk> <unk> in particular if there are people thinking about group.
Since years ago, since I've been interested in <unk> I've also been interested in looking at the sex difference.
And one of the things that have been interested in is the differences between men and women in terms of thinking and operate in the world.
And what we know about <unk> studies is that women, on average, not all, but in <unk> tend to pay more attention to complex social relationships and try to deal with complex social relationships in the group.
And if we think about that, we have an interesting situation in our hands.
years ago, when I was in graduate school, one of my <unk> I knew I was interested in Feminism -- <unk> I thought I was <unk> as <unk> made me a <unk>
<unk> what has women's <unk>
And I thought, "It's the stupidest question I've ever heard.
Feminism has to do with rid of rid of the <unk> of gender, so there's nothing feminine in the <unk>
But the more I've ever thought about your question, more has something like a female thing in the <unk>
That is, there might be something, on average, something different between the brain and the male that makes us more <unk> to complex social relationships and willing to help the most vulnerable.
So if you want them, they were very attentive to find the way to protect people from the state, it's possible that, to have more <unk> to this concept, maybe we would have enriched the concept of protection with <unk> support.
And maybe that's what we need to do in the future when we make democracy beyond <unk> thinking less in the individual body, in terms of identity, and thinking more about relationships.
So as we try to create a more perfect, let's think about what we do for each other.
Thank you.
In 2007, I decided we had to rethink how we think about economic development.
Our new goal should be that when every family thinks that when every family think about where to go live and work, have the ability to choose between at least a handful of different cities that are competing to attract new residents.
Well, right now, we are far from that goal.
There are billions of people in developing countries who don't have a single city willing to <unk>
But the amazing thing about cities is that they're worth more than their cost of construction.
So we could easily <unk> the world -- maybe hundreds of new cities.
Well, this may sound absurd if you never thought about new cities.
But they just took over the buildings from apartments.
Imagine half of those who wanted to live in apartments as well as owners and the other half still <unk> to do that.
You could try to increase the ability to increase in all the existing buildings.
But you know that the problem that <unk> is that those buildings and the areas that around them have rules to avoid the <unk> and the distractions for construction.
So it would be very difficult to do all those <unk>
But you could go to a totally new, build an entirely new apartment building -- always and when the rules of that <unk> place is going to be done instead of <unk>
So I proposed that governments were going to bring new reform zones big enough to contain cities and give them a name, cities under <unk>
I later learned that more or less at the same time, <unk> and <unk> were thinking about the challenge of reform Honduras.
Did you know that every year about 75,000 <unk> would come from their country to go to the United States, and they wanted to ask what they could do to make sure that those people could stay and do those same things in Honduras.
In the summer of 2009, <unk> passed through a constitutional constitutional crisis.
In the next presidential elections, <unk> <unk> led to a platform in which they <unk> reforms and the same reconciliation.
He asked <unk> to be his boss of <unk>
Meanwhile, I was preparing to give a TED Talk.
Through a process of <unk> trial and error and a lot of testing with users, I tried to reduce this complicated concept of cities under the most essential.
The first point was the importance of norms, as those rules that say you can't go and pick up all the current residents of apartments.
We have a lot of attention to new technologies, but it needs so much of technologies like rules for <unk> and usually they are the rules that keep us going forward.
In the fall of 2010, a Guatemala friend of Guatemala sent a link to the TEDTalk.
I showed you to <unk>
They called me up.
They said to me, <unk> this to the leaders of our <unk>
So in December we met in Miami, a conference room in a hotel.
I tried to explain to you this point about how valuable cities are, much more valuable than their cost <unk>
And I used this image that shows the value of land in a place like New York City. That in some cases, is worth billions per square meter.
But it was a pretty abstract discussion and at some point, when a pause, <unk> said, <unk> maybe we could see the video of the <unk> Talk.
And the talk described in very simple terms, that a city under <unk> is a place where you start with <unk> terrain -- a <unk> that <unk> the rules that are <unk> there and an option for people to choose if they want to go or not live under those norms.
So the president of <unk> called me, and he told me that we had to do this project, this is important, this could be the path for our country to move on.
He asked me to go to <unk> and talk again about the four and five of January.
So I presented another talk full of data, which included an image like this, that I was trying to explain that to <unk> a lot of value to a city, this has to be very big.
This is a picture of <unk> and the white line is the new airport that was built in <unk>
Only this airport covers over 100 square miles.
So I was trying to convince the <unk> that to build a new city, you have to start with a site that was <unk> at least 1,000 square miles.
That's over 100,000 acres.
All the world <unk> <unk>
The public faces were very serious and <unk>
The Congress leader came up to the platform and said, <unk> <unk> thank you so much for his talk, but maybe we could see the video of the TED Talk.
I have this in my <unk>
So I felt and showed me the TEDTalk.
And this explained that a new city can offer new choices for people.
There would be a choice of a city that could be in <unk> instead of hundreds of miles away into the North.
And we also have new choices for leaders.
Because the leaders of the government of <unk> they would need help from countries to benefit from countries that could benefit from countries that help them set up and make rules of <unk> so that everybody could rely on that the <unk> actually <unk>
We went and we saw a site.
This picture is there.
It could just take a thousand square miles.
And shortly after the 19th of January, voted in Congress to <unk> its Constitution and add a constitutional available to allow you to create these special development regions.
In a country that I had just passed through this <unk> crisis -- the voting in favor of this constitutional company, was from <unk> to one.
All the <unk> all the <unk> in the society, the <unk>
For <unk> in the Constitution you have to pass twice in Congress.
The 17 of February spent another time in another voting event -- <unk> to one.
Immediately after the voting after the <unk> in February, a delegation of about 30 <unk> was to the two places in the world that are more interested in participating in building cities.
One of them is South Korea.
This is a picture of a new city center in the city that is building in South Korea is bigger than the center of Boston.
All you see there was built in four years after four years to get the <unk>
The other country interested in building cities is Singapore.
In fact, they've built two cities in China and are preparing for a third.
And if you think about this, this is the point where we are.
They have a place, and they're thinking about a site for the second town.
They are preparing a legal system that would allow the <unk> to be able to operate under an external legal system.
A country has committed to allow his Supreme Court to be the last sentence for this new <unk> system.
There are <unk> and builders, cities that are very interested in the project.
You can even get some funding.
But the only thing we know that they've solved is that they have a good number of inhabitants.
There are a lot of companies that wanted to be installed in <unk> especially in a place with a trading zone, and there are a lot of people who would like to go to live there.
In the world there are 700 million people who say they would like to change immediately to another place.
There's a million a year coming out of Latin America to go to the United States.
Many of them are parents who have to leave their family back to their family to get a job -- sometimes they are deceased mothers, who have to earn money to just eat or buy clothes.
Unfortunately, sometimes even kids are trying to meet with their parents who haven't seen in some cases in a decade.
So what do you think about building a new city in <unk>
Or build a dozen of these, or a hundred of these around the world?
What seems to think about insist on insist that families can choose between various cities that are competing to attract new <unk>
This is an idea worth spreading.
And my <unk> friends asked me to say, "Thank me."
I'm a <unk> and this is my <unk>
But before I show you what there is inside, I'm going to make a confession public -- which is that, I live obsessed with <unk>
I love to find, with, and more recently, to photograph and publish in my blog suits and colorful and different for every time.
But I don't buy anything new.
All my clothes is from the second hand of <unk> markets and <unk>
Ah, thank you.
The second hand stores allow me to reduce the impact of my <unk> in the environment and in my <unk>
I go to know people who are passionate about -- usually my money goes to a good <unk> My aspect is <unk> and buying it into my personal search for <unk>
I mean, what am I going to find today?
My size?
I would like color color.
cost less than 20 dollars?
If all the answers are <unk> then I feel I've won.
To go back to my <unk> I want to tell you what we were doing for this exciting week at TED.
I mean, what do you bring to someone who has all that <unk>
So I'm going to show you exactly what I suit.
I've brought up seven pairs of underwear, and nothing else.
You're going inside for exactly one week is all I put in my <unk>
I thought I'd be able to find everything else I would like to use after you get here to <unk>
And because you don't know me as the woman who walks at TED in inner underwear,  that means I found some things.
And I'd like to show you now the sets for this week.
It doesn't sound interesting?
And as I do, I'm also going to tell you some of the lessons of life that, <unk> or not, I've learned in this adventure of not using new clothing.
Let's start with Sunday.
I call this a brilliant tiger.
You don't have to spend a lot of money to look good.
You can almost always see it phenomenal for less than 50 dollars.
All the together, including the <unk> it took me <unk> and it's the most expensive thing I've used in the week.
<unk> the color is energy.
It's almost <unk> impossible to be <unk> when you're wearing a bright red <unk>
If you're happy, you're going to attract other happy people.
<unk> The integration is <unk>
I've spent a lot of time in life trying to be myself and at the same time <unk>
Just yourself.
If you get rid of the right people, not only are you going to tell you, you will also give you.
<unk> <unk> of the child that you carry in.
Sometimes people tell me that it seems to play the <unk> or I remind you to give you their <unk>
I like to <unk> and say, <unk>
<unk> trust is the key one.
If you think you do good with something, it's pretty sure you are.
And if you think you don't do good with something, it's probably true.
My mother taught me this day after day.
But it wasn't until 30 years I really understood her meaning.
And I'm going to explain it in a few seconds.
If you think you're a beautiful person in your inside and outside, there is no eyes you can't <unk>
So there's no excuse for anyone in this audience.
We must be able to achieve everything we want to do.
Thank you.
<unk> A universal truth six words for you: The golden <unk> go with everything.
And finally, <unk> <unk> a personal and unique way of telling the world something about you without having to say a word.
I've tried it over and over again when people approached me this week simply by what I was using, and we had fantastic conversations.
Obviously this is not going to go into my little <unk>
So before I went home, in Brooklyn, and I'm going to donate it all.
Because the lesson I'm trying to learn this week is that you have to leave certain things.
I don't need to <unk> these things, because back in the corner, there will always be another little bit crazy, colorful and brilliant <unk> if there's a little love in my heart and it comes up.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
This is a representation of your brain that we can split into two parts.
On the left-hand side, which is the logic, and the right side, which is the intuitive part.
So if we put a scale to measure the strength.
For example, this would be someone who is completely logical.
This would be somebody who is totally intuitive.
So where do you get your brain at this scale?
Some of them are <unk> by one of these extremes, but I think for most members of this audience, their brain is something like -- with a great <unk> in both <unk> at the same time.
It's not that they're mutually exclusive.
You can be logical and intuitive.
I consider me one of those people, as well as most of the other quantum <unk> <unk> we need pretty much logic to <unk> these complicated ideas.
But at the same time, we need quite intuition to make the experiments really working.
How do we develop this <unk> Well, we like to play things.
We put it to play with them, and then we see as <unk> and then we developed our intuition from that point.
And actually, you do the same thing.
As a intuition that you can have developed over the time is the one that says one thing can be only in one place at once.
I mean, it may sound weird to think that one thing is in two different places at the same time, but you weren't born with this <unk> <unk>
I remember watching a kid playing a parking bar.
It was a small child, and I didn't do it very well, they always <unk>
But I bet you play playing with that bar of parking lot taught you a wonderful lesson, and it is that big things don't allow the <unk> to stay in a place.
This is a great conceptual model that you can have in the world, except be a particle physicist.
It would be a terrible model for a particle physicist, because they don't play with parking bars and play with these strange particles.
And when they play with their particles, they discover they do all kinds of really rare things -- like they can go through walls, or that can be in two different places at the same time.
And then they wrote all these observations, and called the theory of quantum mechanics.
At that point was the physics of physics, some years ago; you needed of quantum mechanics to describe those little particles.
But you didn't need you to describe the big objects around us every day.
That didn't fit very well to my intuition, and maybe I don't play very often with particles.
Well, sometimes I play with them, but not too much.
And I've never seen them.
I mean, nobody saw a <unk>
But it didn't fit well to my logic.
Because if everything is made out of little particles and all the small particles follow the principles of quantum mechanics, then I shouldn't all follow the principles of quantum mechanics in it.
I don't find the reason why I didn't should.
And so I would feel much better if I could somehow prove that a common object follows the principles of quantum mechanics.
That's why a few years ago, I proposed to do exactly that.
And I did.
This is the first object that you can see that has been in a biological mechanical mechanics.
What we see here is a little computer chip.
And you can try to see the green dot right in the middle.
That's the little metal I'm going to talk about in a minute.
This is a picture of the object.
And here I'm going to zoom in a little bit. It's found right in the center.
And then we do a good focus on the little metal <unk>
What we see is a little little metal little metal -- with a springboard and <unk> <unk> on a platform.
And then I did this almost just the same way you would do a computer chip.
I went to a clean room with a custom silicon chip, and I put all the big machines for about 100 hours.
For the last material, I had to build my own machine -- to make this bore hole in a way of swimming that is under the device.
This device has the ability to be in a quantum overlap but it needs a little bit of help.
Let me make an analogy.
You know how awkward it is to be in an elevator full of people.
I mean, when I'm on an elevator alone, I do all sorts of weird things, but then when other people go up with doing those things, because I don't want to bother you, or really, <unk>
Quantum mechanics says that inanimate objects behave in the same way.
The <unk> of <unk> objects are not just people, it's also the light that they <unk> and the wind goes on and the heat of the room.
So we knew that if we wanted this little metal to behave according to quantum mechanics, we would have to <unk> all the other passengers.
And that's what we did.
<unk> the lights, then we introduced a <unk> and pulled all the air down and pulled it down to a temperature of less than a degree of less than zero at all.
Now, when you're only in the <unk> the little metal piece is free of acting as you want.
So we measured their motions.
We found that it moved in very strange ways.
Instead of staying still, it was vibrating. And the way they <unk> it was like a breathing of this form -- as a <unk> that expands and <unk>
And by giving it a soft thrust, we were able to make it <unk> and you don't want to make it at the same time -- something that only happens with quantum mechanics.
So what I'm telling you is something really fantastic.
What does it mean is that a <unk> thing, and they didn't go to the same time?
Let's think about atoms.
In one case, all the trillion atoms that make up that piece of metal are still and at the same time those same atoms are moving up and down to the bottom.
It's only in certain <unk> when those are <unk>
The rest of the time are <unk>
It means that every atom is in two different places at the same time, which means that all the metal piece is in two different places.
I think this is great.
Seriously.
It is worth <unk> in a clean room to do this for all those years -- because, look at this, the difference in scale between one atom and that little metal is more or less the same as the difference between that little metal and you.
So if one atom can be in two different places at the same time, and that piece of metal can be in two different places, why don't you as well?
I mean, it's my logical part that I talk about.
So imagine if you were in many places at the same time, how would that be that?
How do you act your consciousness if your body was <unk> in space?
There's another part of the story.
And it's when we got it, and we turned the lights and looked inside the box, we saw that the metal was still there in one piece.
And I could get to this new intuition, apparently all of the objects in the elevator actually are quantum objects that are just <unk> in a little space.
You hear a lot about talking a lot about that quantum mechanics says everything is interconnected.
Well, that's not that <unk>
It's more profound than that.
So those connections, your connections to all the things that around you, literally define who you are, and that's the deep strangeness of quantum mechanics.
Thank you.
My name is <unk>
And it was 18 months ago, I was doing another job at Google, until I launched the idea of doing something related to museums and art to my boss who allowed me to take it.
I took 18 months to me.
Lots of negotiations and stories, they were going to get it up with 17 very interesting museums in nine countries.
But I'm going to focus on <unk>
There's a lot of stories from why we did.
I think my own story is just explaining just in this slide, and this is access.
I grew up in India.
<unk> of a great education -- not <unk> but I didn't have access to many of these museums and works of art.
So when I started traveling and going to museums, I started learning a lot.
And working on Google, I try to actually make the desire to make it more accessible by technology.
So we formed a team, a big team of people, and we started doing it.
I want to show you the demo to then tell you a couple of interesting things that we've done since his launch.
So let's say, let's go to <unk>
Look around all the museums there.
There's the gallery <unk> the <unk> the <unk> the <unk>
I actually go into one of my favorites, to the <unk> the art museum in New York.
There are two ways of doing it -- very simple.
We click and <unk> we're inside the museum.
No matter where they are, or <unk> or <unk> that doesn't really matter.
You move around and <unk>
Do you want to navigate the <unk>
We opened on the top, and with one click, we jump inside.
They're inside, they want to go at the end of the hall,
And keep going on.
<unk>
Thank you, but I haven't reached the best.
Now I'm in front of one of my favorite paintings -- "The <unk> of <unk> <unk> in the <unk>
I see the <unk> sign.
If the museum shows us the image, we click there.
See, this is one of the images.
Here's all the information from <unk>
For those of you who are really interested in art, you can click there, but I'm going to click here right now.
And this is one of the images we've captured in what we call <unk> technology.
So this image, for example, I think, about 10,000 billion <unk>
And there's a lot of people who ask, "What do you get with 10,000 billion <unk>
So I'll show you what you can actually get with 10,000 billion <unk>
You can zoom around in a very simple way.
You see things that are going on.
I love this guy, his expression doesn't have a price.
But if you really want to give them <unk>
So I started to play, and I found something that was happening there.
And I said, "A moment, this seems <unk>
I went in, and I found that the kids were actually playing something.
And so I did a little bit, I talked to some people from the <unk> and actually I found that this is a game called <unk> which is actually hitting a <unk> with a stick on the Tuesday <unk>
And apparently it was very popular.
I don't know why they did, but I've learned something about it.
And now we're going to get deeper into depth and see that you can actually get even the cracks.
Now just to give you a little bit of perspective, I'm going to remove the image, so you'll see what there is.
This is where we were, and this is the painting.
The best thing is to come, one second.
So now we're going quickly to jump over again at MoMA in New York.
Here's another one of my favorites, "The night <unk>
The example I showed was to find details.
But what if you want to see the <unk>
And if you want to see how Van Gogh actually created this piece.
It increases it and really <unk>
I'm going to one of my favorite parts in this picture, and I'm really going to get to the cracks.
This is <unk> night, I think I'd never seen it before.
I'm going to show you another one of my favorite functions.
There are lots of things over here, but I don't have time to <unk>
This is the really cool part. It's called <unk>
All of you, absolutely everybody, no matter whether it's rich or poor, or if you have a <unk> that gives you the same.
You can make it online to create your own museum collection from all these images.
It's very simple, we walk in, I've created this function that I call "The <unk> <unk> -- we just made a zoom around.
This is <unk> at the National Gallery in London.
You can write things, send your friends to your friends and keep a conversation about what you feel when you look at this <unk>
So in conclusion, I think to me, the main thing is that all amazing things don't really come from Google.
No, in my opinion, also not come from museums.
Maybe I shouldn't say this.
Actually, they come from those artists.
And that's been my humble experience with this.
I mean, I hope that in this digital <unk> does justice to its artwork that is represented properly online.
And the big question that makes me today is, "You did this to repeat the experience of going to a <unk>
And the answer is no.
It's to supplement the experience.
And that's it. Thank you.
Thank you.
Good evening everybody.
I have something to show you.
Think of it is a <unk> a <unk>
In our lab, we call it sensitive design.
I'll tell you a little bit about this.
If you look at this picture -- I'm from Italian origin -- all the kids in Italy in Italy grow with this picture on the wall of his bedroom. But the reason I show you this is that it has been something very interesting in <unk> careers -- one in the last two decades.
Some time ago, if you wanted to win a <unk> race career, I would take a budget and take it to a good car and a good car.
And if the car and the pilot was good enough, you made the career.
This is what in engineering, in engineering, there is real control system.
It's essentially a system that has two <unk> a sensor and a <unk>
Now what's interesting is that the control systems systems are starting to enter our lives.
Our cities, over the last few years, have been covered in networks and electronics.
They're becoming computers in the free air.
And as <unk> they're starting to answer differently and can be <unk> and <unk>
<unk> cities is a big thing.
As a note other -- I wanted to mention that cities are only two percent of the cortex on the planet but they represent 50 percent of the population <unk>
75 percent of the <unk> consumption -- and to 80 percent of CO2 emissions.
If we could do something with cities, it would be a big thing.
Beyond cities, all these <unk> and <unk> are entering our everyday objects.
This is from an exhibition of <unk> <unk> for the last year at MoMA, during the summer.
It's called <unk>
Well, our objects, the environment, they start to <unk>
It's kind of like almost all of the existing atoms -- they become sensors and <unk>
And that's changing the interaction that as human beings have with the outside environment.
It's almost like the old dream of Miguel <unk>
You know, when Michelangelo <unk> the <unk> he says that at the end he took the hammer and he threw it on the Moses -- and you can still see a little bit of a <unk> <unk> and he said, <unk> <unk> non <unk> -- and what don't you know?
Well, today, for the first time, our environment starts to <unk>
And I'm going to show you just about <unk> <unk> in the idea of taking the environment and push something.
Let's start with the detection.
The first project I wanted to share with you is actually one of the first projects of our lab.
This was four and a half years in Italy.
It was a summer of 2006.
It was the year that Italy won the World Cup <unk>
Maybe some of the remember, they played Italy and France, and at the end, he gave the <unk>
And anyway, I finally won Italy.
Now let's see what happened that day by looking at activity in the network.
Here we see the city.
You see the <unk> in the middle and the <unk> River.
It's the morning before the game.
The timeline.
In the late afternoon, there are people around here and doing <unk>
It begins the <unk> silence.
<unk> from France.
They <unk> people a quick call on the bathroom.
Second time. End of time.
<unk> <unk> second.
<unk> and at a moment, the <unk>
They win Italy, <unk>
That night all of them were to <unk> the center.
There you see the great summit.
The next day, everybody went to the middle of the TED team and the prime minister then.
And then everybody went down.
You see the image of the place called <unk> <unk> where, at the time, people are going to <unk> it's a great party, you can see the peak at the end of the day.
This is just an example of how today you can measure the pulse of the city in a way that we wouldn't have been able to do just a few years ago.
Another quick example of <unk> it's not about people, but things we use and consume them.
Today we know all about the background of our objects.
This is a map that shows all of the chips that make up a <unk> how they <unk>
But we know very little about where things are.
So in this project we developed little tiny tags to track the trash in its change in the system.
We started with a few volunteers who helped us in Seattle recently over a year to label what they were <unk> different kinds of things, as you can see, things that are all <unk>
Then we put a little chip, one tag on the garbage and then we started <unk>
These are the <unk> results.
From <unk>
after a week.
With this information we realized there are lots of <unk> in the system.
We can do the same with much less energy.
These are data that they didn't exist.
They're happening in complicated things, and there's a lot of transportation <unk>
But the other thing we believe is that if we look at every day that the cup we dropped doesn't forgot that is still somewhere on the planet.
And if the plastic bottle that you take a day is still there.
So if we show that to people, then we can promote some change of behavior.
That was the reason for the project.
My colleague at MIT, <unk> <unk> I could tell us much more about detecting and many other great things that we can do with that, but I wanted to go to the second part we talked about at the beginning, which is push on the environment.
And the first project is something we did a couple years ago in <unk>
It started with a question of the mayor of the city, who came and told us that Spain and Southern Europe have a beautiful tradition of the use of water in public space, in architecture.
And the question was, how can technology, new technology, join that?
And one of the ideas that we developed at MIT, in a shop was, imagine you have a <unk> and <unk> valves <unk> that open and open up.
It was created like a water, with pixels of water.
If you fall down the pixels you can write in them, show patterns, images, texts.
And by the <unk> the curtain will open for us to happen, as you see in the image.
We introduced this to the mayor <unk>
I liked a lot of it.
And they took a commission to design the <unk> of the <unk>
We call it <unk> <unk>
The whole building is made of water.
There is no windows, but when you come up with it it opens up so you can make it happen.
The ceiling is also covered in water.
And if there's a little bit of wind, if you want to minimize the <unk> goes down the roof.
Or you can close the building and all the architecture disappears, like in this case.
And that days will always be somebody, in the winter, when the roof, someone who was there and he said, <unk> the <unk>
No, it's not that you've got it, but when you go down almost all architecture goes down.
This is actually working.
You see people <unk> so they go inside.
And here I'm myself trying to do not <unk> when the test sensors open the water.
I think I should tell you what happened one night when all the sensors stopped working.
That night was actually even more fun.
All the children of <unk> came to the building because the way to interact had changed a little bit.
It was no longer a building that would open to let you go, but a building that kept doing <unk> and <unk> and you had to jump down to <unk>
<unk> noise) And for us that was really interesting because as architects, engineers, designers, we always think about how people give our designs to our designs.
But then the reality is always unpredictable.
And that's the beauty of doing things to interact, that people use it.
This is a picture of the building with the pixels of water, the pixels of water, and of projections about them.
And this is what led us to thinking about the next project I'm going to show you.
Imagine that those pixels could begin to fly.
Imagine that you could have little helicopters in the air, and every one had a little pixel that changes color as if it was a cloud that moves in space.
This is the video.
Imagine a helicopter, which we saw before, which moves with others in sync.
Could we form this cloud,
A kind of flexible screen like this with a normal standard in two dimensions.
Or normal, but in three dimensions, what it changes is the light, not the position of the <unk>
You can play with a different guy.
Imagine the screen appears on different scales and sizes, in different types of resolution.
And then all of that could be a cloud of pixels in 3D, where you can zoom in, and you can see from very different perspectives.
This is the real <unk> <unk> going down.
When the light lights up, you see this. The same thing we saw before.
Imagine each one of them controlled by one person.
We can have each pixel with a input that comes from people, the movement of people, etc., etc.
I want to show you something for the first time.
We've been working with <unk> <unk> <unk> of the best dancers of ballet ballet dancers today, the star from New York and <unk> <unk> to capture their 3D movements and use them as input for <unk>
Here we can see <unk> dancing.
On the left, you see the <unk> the capture in different <unk>
It's so much 3D digitization in real time as motion capture.
You can make all the movement.
You can run the whole way.
And once we have the pixels we can play with them, with the color and movement, with gravity and <unk>
We want to use this as a possible entry for the <unk>
I wanted to show you the last project we're working on.
It's something for the London Olympics.
It's called the <unk>
And the idea is, imagine again, that we could engage people to do something and change our environment, like an oyster nursery like <unk> <unk> but with a cloud.
Imagine that we could make all of them <unk> a little bit for a <unk>
And I think the remarkable thing that has happened in the last few years is that, in the last two decades, we go from the physical world to the digital world.
We've digitized everything, like knowledge, and is accessible to the Internet.
Today, for the first time -- and the Obama campaign we can tell you, we can move from the digital world, of the <unk> power of the networks, to the physical world.
In our case, this might be able to use it to design and make a <unk>
That would mean something built in a city.
But tomorrow can be to address the challenges of today: think about climate change or CO2 emissions -- how do you go from the digital world to the physical world?
The idea is that we can make people involved in doing this together, in a collective form.
The cloud is a cloud, again, made of pixels in the same way that the real cloud is a cloud of particles.
And those particles are water, whereas in our cloud are <unk>
It's a physical structure in London, but covered with <unk>
You can move ahead and have different experiences.
You can see from below, to be to share the main moments of the 2012 2012 and even more, and it can be used as a way of connection to the community.
So it's so much a physical cloud of the sky as something you can climb up, like a new top of London.
You can go into there.
As if it was a new digital <unk> at night, but the most important thing is to be a new experience for anybody to go to the top.
Thank you.
Would you like to be better than what they are?
Suppose I told you that, with only a lot of changes in their genes, they could improve <unk> by more precise, more accurate and faster.
Or maybe they would like to be more strong, have more <unk>
Would you like to be more attractive and sure of themselves?
How about living more with good health?
Or maybe be those people who always wanted to be more creative.
What is it that they <unk>
What do you want, if you could choose something?
<unk> <unk> <unk>
How many people do creativity?
Raise your hand.
<unk> I probably owe to the number of creative people present.
That's very good.
How many would do to choose memory?
A few more.
And the physical state.
A little less.
How about <unk>
And that makes me feel very well as a doctor.
If you could have some of this that the world would be very different.
It's just <unk>
Or maybe be possible?
Evolution has been a <unk> theme here at the TED Conference. I want to give you the view of a doctor on it.
The great <unk> of the 20th century, <unk> <unk> who also <unk> in the Church <unk> <unk> wrote an essay called "Nothing in biology -- it makes sense except to light of <unk>
But if you actually embrace biological evolution to consider this: it's just about the past, or the future?
It's about the other or us?
This is another look at the tree of life.
The human part of this branch, good at one end is, of course, the most interest in us.
We have a common ancestor with the modern chimpanzees about six or eight million years ago.
In the interval there have been maybe 20 or 25 different species of <unk>
Some have gone and <unk>
We have been here about <unk> years.
It might seem to be that we're very far away from other parts of this tree of life, but actually, in most of the basic machinery of our cells is roughly the same.
You realize that we can leverage and control the machinery of a common bacterium to produce the protein of human insulin that is used to treat <unk>
This is not as human insulin but it's the same protein, chemically <unk> that comes out of <unk>
And by talking about bacteria -- you realize that we all take into the most bacteria that the cells we have in the rest of the body?
Maybe 10 times more.
I mean, think -- when Antonio <unk> is raises the <unk> you think of the <unk>
The gut is a wonderfully strong environment for those bacteria.
It's warm -- dark, wet, it's very <unk>
And we're going to give them all the nutrients that you can want without effort to want it.
It's really like a fast thing for the bacteria with the occasional <unk> of some hasten rush into the output.
But for that, we are a wonderful environment for those bacteria in the same way that they are essential to our life.
They help digest nutrients and protect us from certain diseases.
But what are we telling us the future?
We're in a sort of an evolutionary balance as a species?
Or meant to become something different, something maybe better adapted to <unk>
In this vast symphony <unk> of the universe, life on Earth is like a brief <unk> the animal kingdom, as a single and unique <unk> and human life, a little bit of grace.
That was us.
And it was also the <unk> part of this talk, so I hope you've got it.
When I first went to college I had my first kind of biology.
I was fascinated by the elegance and the beauty of biology.
I fell in love with the power of evolution, and I realized something fundamental -- in most of the existence of life, in the <unk> organisms, each cell is just divided and all the genetic energy in that cell is transmitted to two daughters.
But when <unk> organisms appear to change.
It goes in stage sexual reproduction.
And something very important -- with the emergence of sexual reproduction that is happening the rest of the body becomes <unk>
In fact, you might say that the <unk> of the death of the body comes into evolution at the same moment of sexual reproduction.
I have a confession that when I was a college student thinking, well, <unk> death for <unk> seemed pretty reasonable at that time, but with every year he was happening, every time I had more <unk>
I got to understand the feelings of George <unk> who still competed in Las Vegas in their 90 years.
And one night someone hits her door door to his hotel door.
He opens the door.
In front of him, you find a little <unk> <unk>
And he looks at it and says, <unk> looking for a <unk> <unk>
"It's right." He says, "I chose the <unk>
I realized, as a doctor, who was working for a different target for the goal of <unk> not necessarily <unk> only different.
I was trying to preserve the body.
I wanted you to get healthy enough.
I wanted to regain health in disease.
I wanted them to live more and healthier.
Evolution is to pass the genome into the next <unk> adapting and <unk> generation after generation.
From an evolutionary point of view you and I are like <unk> rockets -- designed to send the genetic burden to the next level, and then let us fall into the sea.
I think that all of us will make the feeling that Woody Allen when he said, "I don't want to achieve immortality through my work.
I want to <unk> you not <unk>
Evolution is not necessarily about longevity.
It doesn't necessarily favors the biggest or the stronger or the faster or even the more intelligent ones.
Evolution favors the best adapted to their environment.
That's the only test for survival and success.
In the bottom of the ocean -- the <unk> bacteria that can survive the heat of the <unk> that would be <unk> if there were fish there, fish there, and yet they've managed to do that a <unk> environment.
So what does this mean when we look at what's happening in evolution and if we go back to thinking about the place of humans in evolution, and in particular, if we look forward to the <unk> phase -- I would say there are many possibilities.
The first one is that I don't know.
We've reached a kind of balance.
And the underlying reasoning would be that through medicine, first of all, we've known to preserve a lot of genes than otherwise would have been <unk> and collapse from the population.
And secondly, as a species, we have <unk> our environment so that we can adapt to us as well as we adapt to it.
And by the way, <unk> <unk> and <unk> us, so much that it is no longer possible to have the isolation for evolution.
A second possibility is that there is a evolution of natural type, naturally by the forces of nature.
And the argument here is, the gears of evolution roll slowly, but they're <unk>
And in terms of <unk> when we <unk> distant planets are going to be the isolation and environmental changes that can produce evolution in a natural way.
But there is a third possibility, a possibility to do, intriguing and terrifying possibility.
I call this <unk> the new evolution, which is not simply <unk> but <unk> and elected for us as individuals in the decisions that we <unk>
Now, how could this happen?
How could we do this?
We first consider the reality that many people today, in some cultures, are making decisions about their offspring.
In some cultures, they're choosing to have more males than women.
It's not necessarily a good thing for society, but it's what you choose to the individual and family level.
Think also that if we could be able to choose not only the sex of their <unk> but in their own body to make genetic adjustments to cure or prevent disease.
And if we could make the genetic changes to eliminate diabetes or Alzheimer's or reduce the risk of cancer or <unk>
You wouldn't want to make those changes in your <unk>
If we look at the future that kind of changes is going to be increasingly possible.
The Human Genome Project began in 1990, she sued 13 years.
<unk> <unk> million dollars.
After being finished, in 2004, I could do the same work for 20 million dollars in three or four months.
Today, you can get a whole sequence of the three billion base pairs in the human genome at a cost near 20,000 and a week.
Not so much to make the human genome actually to make the human genome for <unk> and getting more and more the scope of all.
These changes.
The same technology that has produced human insulin in bacteria can make viruses that are not only going to protect us from themselves, but they're going to induce <unk> against other viruses.
You know, or there's no experimental trial in the course of the flu flu -- in the cells of a tobacco plant.
Can you imagine something good that comes out of <unk>
That's actually today and the future is going to be increasingly possible.
Imagine just another two little <unk>
They can change the cells in their bodies but if they could change the cells from their <unk>
And if they could change sperm and <unk> or change the newly <unk> egg -- and give their children a better opportunity for a healthier life, eliminate diabetes, eliminate <unk> reduce the risk of cancer?
Who doesn't want more <unk>
And then, that same <unk> technology, that same engine of science that can produce changes to prevent diseases is going to be able to also adopt <unk> <unk> a better memory.
Why don't you have the ingenuity of a Ken <unk> especially if you could <unk> with the next generation of <unk> machine.
Why don't you have a faster muscle to allow us to run faster and more <unk>
Why don't you live more time?
This is going to be <unk>
And when we are in conditions of organizing this to the next generation and we can adopt the attributes that we wanted to design before in <unk>
We're going to take a process that normally could take 100,000 years, and we can rotate it at 1,000 years and maybe within the next 100 years.
These are choices that their grandchildren, or the grandchildren of their grandchildren, are going to have them.
We're going to use these choices for a more successful society, more successful society.
Or, we're going to choose selectively identify different attributes that we want for some of us but not for the others?
We're going to build a society that is more boring and more robust or more <unk>
This is the kind of question we're going to have to face.
And the deepest thing about all: we're going to be able to develop wisdom and inherit the wisdom necessary to make these <unk> decisions.
For good or for worse, before what it might be, these choices are going to depend on us.
Thank you.
Imagine a great explosion when you're at 900 square feet high.
Imagine a plane full of smoke.
Imagine an engine doing <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Well, I had a single seat that day. He was sitting in the <unk>
It was the only one I could talk about flight <unk>
So I immediately looked at them, and they said, "There's no problem. <unk> some <unk>
And the pilot had already <unk> the plane, and we weren't so far.
You could see Manhattan.
Two minutes later, three things happened at the same time.
The pilot runs the plane with the Hudson River.
Mostly that's not the <unk>
The motors.
Imagine being on an airplane and without noise.
And then he said three words.
The three <unk> words I've heard.
He said, <unk> for <unk>
I didn't have to talk more with the flight assistant.
I could see it in his eyes.
<unk> Life <unk>
I want to share with you three things I learned about myself that day.
I learned that everything changes in a second.
We have this list of things to do before I die, these things that we want to do in life, and I thought all the people I wanted to come in, and I didn't do, all the fences that I wanted to repair all of the experiences that I've wanted to have and never <unk>
As I thought about that later on, I came up with a sentence, which is, <unk> wines <unk>
Because if the wine is ready and the person is there, I'm going to open.
I don't want to tell you anything in life.
And that urgency, that purpose, has really changed my life.
The second thing I learned that day -- and this is as I came up with the bridge George Washington, which was not a lot -- I thought about, "I really feel a big <unk>
I've lived a good life.
In my humanity, and with my mistakes I have tried to improve on everything I did.
But in my humanity, I also give rise to my ego.
And I'm sorry that I am going to get involved in things that didn't care about people who do matter.
And I thought about my relationship with my wife, with the people.
And then, as <unk> at that, I decided to remove the negative energy of my life.
It's not perfect, but it's a lot better.
I haven't had a fight with my wife.
It feels like <unk>
I don't try to have <unk> <unk> to be <unk>
The third thing that I learned -- and this is how your mental clock is going to <unk> 14, 14, <unk>
You see the water <unk>
I'm saying, "Please <unk>
I don't want this to be <unk> in 20 pieces like you see in those <unk>
And as I <unk> I had the feeling of, "I will die not fear.
It's almost like we've been <unk> for that all our life.
But it was very sad.
I didn't want to myself, I love my life.
And that sadness goes into a single thought, which is just desire one thing.
I wish I could see my kids grow.
A month later, I was in a performance of my daughter -- first grade, not a lot of artistic talent --  -- <unk>  And I scream, <unk> like a little boy.
And for me, that was the whole reason for me.
At that point I realized that the two points, which the only thing that matters in my life is to be a great parent.
For all, the only goal I have in life is to be a good parent.
I gave me a miracle, not to die of that day.
And gave me another gift, which was the ability to look at the future and go back and live differently.
You who are flying today, the challenge you can imagine that the same thing happens on your plane -- and please not be like that -- but imagine, and how do you work?"
What is it that they <unk> they're still waiting for because they think they're going to live forever.
How do your relationships change and negative energy in them?
And most importantly, they're the best parents that we <unk>
Thank you.
I've been blessed with a lot of <unk> projects.
But the biggest thing I worked was for this guy.
The guy is called <unk>
<unk> was one of the most important <unk> of the '80s.
One day he came home after running and said, "Dad, I feel like <unk> <unk>
And that was the beginning of ALS.
Today, it has total paralysis.
You can only use your eyes.
Her work influenced me.
I have a design firm and animation, so graffiti is something we admire and <unk> in the world of art.
So we decided we were going to go to <unk> to <unk> <unk> and their cause.
So I went and met with her brother and her father and said, "We're going to give you this money.
What are they going to do with <unk>
And his brother said, "Just want to be able to talk to Tony again.
I just want to communicate with him and that he is able to communicate with me."
And I said, "A second -- I don't have to see Stephen <unk> -- not all people with paralysis can communicate through those <unk>
And he said, "No, unless you're someone important and have a safe insurance you can't actually do it.
These devices are not affordable for people."
And I said, "Well, how do you communicate <unk>
Did anybody see the movie "The <unk> and the <unk>
They communicate that way -- they're making it <unk>
I said, "That's <unk> How can it be?"
So I showed up with the only desire to deliver a check, and instead he signed a check, I had no idea how I was going to <unk>
And I met her brother and his father right there at the very precise time, "All right, this is the <unk> Tony going to talk, we're going to build a machine, and we're going to find a way to make her art again.
Because it's ridiculous that someone who have so much inside your inner can't be <unk>
So I talked about a conference a couple of months later.
I met these guys called <unk> <unk> Research <unk> who have a technology that allows them to project a light on any surface and then with a laser pointer -- draw on that and record the negative space.
So they're going around making art facilities like this.
All the things that <unk> they say, are part of a life cycle.
They first start with sex organs, then with bad words, then with the heart attacks, and in the end, people start to make art.
But there was always a life cycle in your <unk>
And so it started the journey.
And about two years later, about a year later, after a year later, and so much to move things from one side to another we had achieved a couple of things.
One, you touch the gates of insurance companies and we got a machine that you could <unk> I could <unk> a machine like Stephen <unk>
Which was great.
And seriously, it's a little bit of the <unk> I call <unk> because when I talk to the guy with an email from him, and you say, "I don't know. This guy's <unk>
The other thing we did was bringing seven programmers from all over the corner of all the corners of the <unk> to our home.
My wife, the children, and I moved to the garage garage and these hackers and programmers and <unk> took control of the house.
Many of our friends thought we were doing something completely stupid and that when they were born, they would have taken the frames out of the walls and his place would be <unk>
But for two weeks, we were going to go to the <unk> <unk> my son as well, and we created this.
It's called <unk> <unk> and you can see the <unk>
These are a couple of <unk> sun that we buy in the Venetian <unk> walk that we buy a copper cable and <unk> <unk> and <unk>
We take a camera on the <unk> we put it on top of an LED light, and now there's a device that's free -- and it builds one place, we published the code, we put software down in a free.
And we create a device that has no limitation at all.
No company says <unk>
There is no hospital that can say <unk>
Any person with paralysis today has access to drawing and communicate using only your eyes.
Thank you.
Thank you very much for you. That was awesome.
So at the end of the two weeks we went back to the <unk> room.
I love this picture because this is the room of another person, and that's her room.
There was all this <unk> and <unk> during the great opening.
And after a year of planning, two weeks of training two weeks of engineering all night, Tony went back for the first time in seven years.
And this is a wonderful picture because this is the support system of his life, and it's looking through the support system of his life.
We ran the bed so I could see.
And we put a projector on a wall of the parking lot of the hospital.
And he went back to drawing her family and friends -- and you can imagine what the feeling was in the parking lot.
The funny thing was that we had to take on the parking lot, so we felt as if we were making a graffiti away, as well.
And at the end of this he sent us an email and this was what we would say, "This was the first time I draw in seven years.
I felt like I had been under the water, and someone finally came to <unk> and would take me out there so that I could <unk>
Isn't it wonderful?
In a way, that's our <unk>
That's what keeps us in movement, developing.
And we have a long way to walk with this.
It's a cool device, but it's the equivalent of a <unk> <unk>
Someone with this artistic potential deserve more.
So we're trying to figure out how to do it and do it faster and robust.
Since then, we've had all kinds of recognition.
We've won a lot of awards.
Remember, it's <unk> none of us are doing money with this.
It all comes out of our own pockets.
The prizes were the <unk> "Oh, this is <unk>
Armstrong <unk> something about us, and then, in December, the Time magazine recognized us as one of the 50 largest inventions of 2010, and it was really cool.
The best thing about all of this -- and this is what ends up by closing the <unk> is that in April of this year at the University of <unk> in the L.A. center is going to be an exhibition called <unk> in the <unk>
And <unk> in <unk> is going to have the best <unk> of urban art, <unk> <unk> <unk> all of them are going to be there.
<unk> is going to be on the show which is pretty impressive.
So basically this is my idea: if you look at something that is not possible, do it possible.
None of you in this room was possible -- the stage, stage, the computer, the microphone, the <unk> nothing was possible at a moment.
Do you get rid of anything in this room.
I'm not programmer, I never did anything with <unk> recognition technology -- I just recognized something and <unk> with wonderful people to make it happen.
And these are the questions that I want you all to do every day when we find something that you feel that you need to do, if it's not now, <unk> And if I'm not me, who?
Thank you, guys.
I've spent the last few years that we would have done in usually very difficult and at the same very dangerous time.
I went to the hard <unk>
I worked in a <unk> mine.
It <unk> in <unk> and dangerous areas.
And I spent 30 days eating this kind of fun in the beginning, something difficult in the middle, very dangerous to the end.
In fact, in much of my career, I've been involved in situations in which horrible appearance with the only goal to try to look at social questions in ways that are <unk> <unk> interesting, and hopefully analyzing them in a way that you see meaningful and accessible to the audience.
So when I knew that I would come here to do a TEDTalk on the world of brands and <unk> I wanted to do something a little bit differently.
So some of you may have heard, or not, a couple of weeks I took a <unk> <unk>
I sent some messages on Facebook, some on Twitter, I offered the rights of the name of my TEDTalk in 2011.
What I had was the following: <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> my TEDTalk that you have no idea what it is about and according to content could be <unk> in the face, especially if I put it to you and your company to do it.
But said this -- it's a very good opportunity to do it.
Do you know how many people look at these <unk>
<unk>
It's a degree in progress, by the way.
So even with that <unk> I knew someone was going to buy the rights of the name.
If you had asked me a year he would have been able to afford it with certainty.
But in the new film that I'm working on, we looked at the world of marketing of advertising.
And as I said earlier, I've been sitting in horrible situations over the last few years, but nothing could have been able to <unk> it for something so difficult or as dangerous as I got into the rooms with these guys.
You see, I had this idea for a film.
Morgan <unk> I want to do a film that I tried to try and enjoy it, and the <unk> and the advertising, and that all the film would be filled with <unk> of products, marketing and advertising.
The film is going to call "The biggest movie ever <unk>
What happens in "The largest movie -- it's all up to the bottom, it's all up to the bottom, it has images of mark, all the time; from the <unk> coming up before the title of the title -- the <unk>
Now this brand <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
These people were <unk> the film to <unk> forever.
And so the film is explores all this idea -- <unk> <unk> is that? Is it <unk> It's <unk>
I'm a <unk> <unk> <unk>
He was <unk> <unk>
But we're not just going to have the sponsor of the brand X in the degree, but we're going to make sure all the categories that we can in the film.
You may have a shoe and you can get the most cool shoe that you get.
The most cool car you've driven in "The largest movie that you've ever <unk> the best drink that you've got <unk> from "The largest movie <unk>
<unk> <unk> The idea is then in addition to showing you brands as part of life, making them <unk> the <unk> <unk> to <unk> the <unk> -- MS: And we actually show the full process of how it works.
The <unk> goal is transparency.
You're going to see all the process in this movie.
That's the full idea, all the movie -- from beginning to end.
And I would love to help you make it happen.
Robert <unk> You know, it's funny because it's the first time I hear that -- it's the maximum respect for the audience.
<unk> However, I don't know how <unk> is going to be the people at that.
<unk> You have a <unk> -- I don't know if you're <unk> it's very <unk> but you know how it goes to <unk> <unk> Not <unk> David <unk> How much money do you need to do this?
MS: About a million and a half million -- <unk> <unk> -- I think it's going to be difficult to meeting, but certainly it's going to be worth getting to convince a couple of big ones.
<unk> Who knows, maybe for the moment the movie comes out, we look at it as a lot of idiots <unk>
MS: What do you think about is going to be the answer?
So Stuart <unk> Most of the answers will be <unk>
MS: But it will be hard to <unk> for the film or to be I?
JK: So two things.
MS: That means you're not really optimistic.
And so I <unk> I need help.
MK: I can help.
MS: All right. <unk> Awesome. Awesome.
MK: We need to think about what brands.
MS: Yes. <unk> That's the <unk> When you look at the people you have to <unk>
MK: We have some places where you go, <unk> <unk> <unk>
MS: I thought <unk> <unk> meant we have a conversation outside the microphone.
<unk> the camera means "We don't want to know anything about your <unk>
MS: And this was, one for one, all of these companies just disappeared.
None wanted to have anything to do with this film.
I was shocked.
They didn't want to know anything with this project.
And I was very <unk> I thought the concept of advertising, I was to present the product to as many people as possible, to make so many people as it was possible.
Especially in the world today, this intersection of new media and old media scenario is not the idea to tell with that new <unk> vehicle that is going to take the message to the <unk>
No, that's what I thought.
But the problem was, you see, my idea had a <unk> error and that mistake was this.
Actually no, there was no such mistake.
There was no mistake at all.
This would have been fine.
But the problem was what this image.
See, when you look for Google images on Google <unk>       This is one of the first images that are coming up.
I like your way to <unk> Sergey <unk> No.
This was the problem: <unk> <unk> or <unk> easily <unk> or <unk> easily <unk> which is characterized by visibility or access of information, especially in <unk> practices.
You see, we heard a lot about transparency in these days.
Our political politicians <unk> the president -- even the <unk> the <unk>
But all of a sudden when it comes to making it really changes very suddenly.
But why? Well, transparency gives <unk>  -- like that <unk> bear that follows <unk>
It's <unk>   Like this weird <unk>
And it's also very risky.
What else is it <unk>
It would be a bowl of <unk> <unk>
That's very risky.
When I started talking to companies and telling them we wanted to tell this story and they said, "No, we want you to <unk> history.
We want to make a story, but we want to make it <unk> <unk>
See, when I was a child, and my father would tell me in a lie -- and there is him staring at me as a <unk> saying, "Son, there's three sides in every story.
Is it your story, it's my story, and there is digital <unk>
As you can see, in this film we wanted to tell the real story.
But with only one company, a agency wanted to help me -- and that only because I knew John Bond and Richard <unk> of many years -- I realized I would have to go through my own, I would have to take off and go to the businesses myself with all my team.
So what I started to realize -- and I started to give me <unk> is that when you start talking to companies the idea of understanding your brand is a universal problem.
MS: So I have friends who make big, huge big, giant films, and others who make small, independent films, like my own.
And my friends who make films of big Hollywood films, a giant people say the reason their movies are so successful because of the brands associated with them.
And then my friends who make films say, "Well, how are we supposed to compete with these large, giant movies of <unk>
And the movie is called "The largest movie ever <unk>
How are we going to see specifically <unk> in the film?
Every time I'm going to go out, every time I open my <unk> you'll see the <unk> <unk>
At any time during an interview with someone can tell you <unk> <unk> for this <unk>
You're ready? You see a little nervous.
I want you to help you with you.
Maybe you should put a little bit of this before <unk>
And there's one of these <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> like <unk> of <unk> are going to have their opportunity.
We're going to have so much for man like <unk> solid, <unk> <unk> in bar, like it.
That's the overall look.
Now I can answer your questions and give you a look at it.
<unk> Frank: We are a small brand.
<unk> to the kind of smaller movies, smaller movies, we are more <unk>
So we don't have the budget to have other brands.
So doing things like this, you know, remind people is the reason why this interests us.
MS: What words would you use to describe <unk>
<unk> is in white.
<unk> That's a great question.
Volunteer: <unk>
MS: Technology is not the way you want to describe something that you put in <unk>
Man: We talk about something funny <unk>
I think <unk> is a great word that actually puts this category at positive versus <unk> smell and <unk>
It keeps you cool.
How do you keep you fresh more time? You get better <unk> three times as well.
Things like those who <unk> the benefits.
MS: And that's a <unk> company.
What about me? What about a common?
I need to talk to the man from the street, to people like me, to the common <unk>
They have to tell me about my brand.
MS: How do you define your <unk>
Volunteer: <unk> my <unk>
I don't know.
I like good clothing.
Woman: They revive the '80s, <unk> <unk> unless it is <unk>
MS: All right, what's the <unk> brand <unk>
<unk> Something unique. You <unk> Man: I guess the kind of gender, the style that I have would be like a <unk> <unk>
I like a lot of dark colors, so many gray colors and things like that.
Usually I take walks of the sun, or I like the crystals and the similar <unk>
Woman: If Dan was a brand could be a <unk> <unk> <unk>
Man 2: I mark this brand <unk> <unk>
Woman 2: In part <unk> partly <unk> partly <unk> I don't know.
Man 3: I'm the kind of pets.
They provide toys for pets in the country and in the world.
So I guess that's my brand.
In my little sector, that's my brand.
Man 4: My brand is <unk> because he was <unk>
Man 5: <unk> <unk> failure.
Is that something?
<unk> I'm a <unk> brand <unk>
<unk> I'm a <unk>
MS: Well, we cannot be brand Tom, but I often <unk> at the intersection of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
I realized I needed an expert.
I needed someone who could enter my head, someone who could help me understand what they call the <unk> <unk>
And I found a company called <unk> <unk> in Pittsburgh.
They helped companies like <unk> <unk> <unk> to discover that brand personality.
If you were able to do it for them, you could surely do it for me.
<unk> <unk> the pictures, right?
MS: Yeah. The first picture is a family photograph.
A: <unk> a little bit of how it relates to your thoughts and feelings of self.
MS: These guys fashion my way to see the world.
A: <unk> of that world.
MS: That world -- I think your world is the world that we want, as the people around you, your friends, your family, the way you live in your life, the work you do.
All those things come up and start in a place and start in my case and start in my family, in West Virginia.
A: What's the next thing you want to talk about?
MS: The next one is "This was the best day of my life."
A: How does this relate to your thoughts, feelings and your way to be?
MS: That's like I want to be me.
I like different things.
I like weird things. I like weird things.
A: <unk> of the <unk> for what is it?
What's the <unk> In which phase of <unk> you find you now?
Why is it important? What is the <unk>
I got a little bit about that.
A little bit more of you, which is not who you are.
What other <unk> have you <unk>
You don't have to be afraid. What kind of rollercoaster are you?
MS:
A: Thank you for your patience.  <unk> Great Yes.
MS: Yeah, I don't know what's going to come out of this.
There was a lot of madness to all over this.
<unk> <unk> The first thing I saw was this idea that there are two different sides -- but it <unk> in your <unk> personality.
They were <unk> very well together.
And I think there's almost a paradox in them.
And I think a few companies will only come into one of their strong dots or in the other rather than focus in both.
Many companies tend to be -- and it's natural nature to avoid the things that are not <unk> avoid fear, those elements, and you actually actually get <unk> and you make something positive for you, and it's nice to see that.
What other brands are this?
The first here is the Apple <unk>
And you can also see here to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
Now there are <unk> brands and brands -- those things that have gone and come in, and a <unk> brand is quite powerful.
MS:
If someone asks you to <unk> your brand identity your brand <unk> what would it be?
You're an <unk> attribute you are someone who makes your blood <unk>
Or are you a <unk> attribute you are.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> attributes are like being playful to be playful like the <unk> contemporary -- bold or bold as <unk> <unk> quickly or <unk> <unk> <unk> or mystical as <unk>
Or are you rather than <unk>
You're conscious, sophisticated as <unk>
You're established, traditional <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
You're <unk> stable, familiar, safe, safe, safe, <unk> or wise <unk> like the Dalai Lama or <unk>
Over the course of this film we had over 500 companies, <unk> and <unk> who said <unk> they didn't want to form part of this project.
They didn't want to have anything to do with this film, mainly because they would have no control over the final product.
They allowed us to tell the story of the <unk> and we get to tell the story in this movie of how you now use MRI MRI to identify the key centers in the brain as much for commercial marketing as a movies.
We went to San Paulo where they have banned advertising to the open.
In the whole city for the last five years, there is no <unk> there is no <unk> there's nothing.
And we went to school districts where companies are getting way in schools with money problems in the U.S.
The amazing thing to me is that the projects that I have had the greatest answer or the ones that I have most successful is those in which I've been doing with things directly.
And that's what these brands.
<unk> the <unk> took their agencies, and they said, perhaps these agencies have my best interest in mind.
I'm going to try directly with the artist.
I'm going to work with him to create something different, something that is going to make people, which is going to challenge the way we look at the world.
And how has it gone? They had a success?
Well, since the movie was sent into the <unk> Festival let's take a look.
According to <unk> the movie is released in January, and since then -- and this is not <unk> we've had 900 million impressions in the media for this film.
This covers only a couple of weeks and a half.
That's just in <unk> or press, no TV.
The film is still not <unk>
It's still not online. It's not in <unk>
It's not even presented in other countries yet.
Ultimately, this film has now started to win momentum.
And it's not bad because most of the agencies that we talk about to give their clients not a part.
I've always believed that if you take risks -- if you take risks that are <unk>
I think when you get to people that are pushing them into failure.
I think when you train their employees in loss <unk> it's preparing their company to be <unk>
I feel that what has to happen to move forward is that we have to encourage people to <unk>
We need to encourage people that are not afraid of the opportunities they can afford.
Ultimately, to move forward, I think we have to give the fear.
We have to put that bear into a cage.
<unk> fear of fear.
From a <unk> at the time, we have to embrace the risk.
And ultimately, we have to harbor transparency.
More than ever a bit of honesty is going to go a long way.
And I said this, with honesty and transparency, all my talk, <unk> has been presented for my good friends of <unk> who for <unk> bought the rights of the name in <unk>
<unk> <unk> big data for companies around the world.
<unk> introduces <unk> <unk>
Thank you very much.
June Cohen: So, <unk> by the name of transparency, which happened exactly with those <unk>
MS: It's a fantastic question.
In my pocket I have a check on the name of the TED organization, the <unk> Foundation -- a check for <unk> to be applied to my attendance for the next year.
The idea behind the Gordian worm is actually very simple.
We don't want Iran to get the nuclear bomb.
Its biggest asset to develop nuclear weapons is the <unk> plant plant.
The gray boxes that you see are control systems in real time.
If we do compromise these systems that control speeds and <unk> we can have a lot of problems with the centrifuge.
The gray boxes are not using <unk> software -- it's a completely different technology.
But if we managed to put a Windows virus from Windows in a portable computer used by an engineer to set up this gray, then we're ready.
This is the plan behind <unk>
We started with an Windows.
The <unk> enters the gray, <unk> <unk> and the Iranian nuclear program is <unk> mission.
It's easy, <unk>
I want to tell you how we discovered this.
When we started investigating about <unk> six months ago, the purpose was completely unknown.
The only thing I knew is that it's very, very complex in the <unk> part of the <unk> the <unk>
It seemed to want to do something with these <unk> boxes.
That was called the attention, and we started an experiment where we <unk> our environment with <unk> and we saw what happened to this.
So they spent very strange things.
<unk> <unk> like a rat rat that didn't like our <unk> the <unk> but I didn't want to eat.
I had no sense to me.
And then to experiment with different flavors of cheese, I realized, and I thought, "This is a <unk> attack.
It's completely <unk>
The <unk> is looking for active in the gray box if you find a specific configuration, and even if the program that's trying to infect is actually working on that <unk>
If not, <unk> does nothing.
So that called my attention, and we started working on this almost 24 hours a day, because we said, "We don't know what the <unk> is.
It might be, let's say for example, an energy plant, or a chemical plant in Germany.
You better have to take the goal soon.
And then we pulled out and <unk> the attack, and we found that I was <unk> in two discrete bombs a little bit and a big one.
We also saw that they were very <unk> armed with people who obviously had all the internal information.
I will take all the dots for the ones to attack.
You probably even know how much we <unk> the operator.
So you know everything.
And if you've heard the <unk> <unk> complex and high technology, let me tell you the load is very complex.
It's very much above everything we've seen before.
Here you see a sample of this code of attack.
We're talking about 15 lines of code.
It looks pretty old language <unk>
I want to tell you how we could find meaning to this code.
What we were looking at was calls to functions of the system, because we know what they do.
Then we were looking at <unk> and structures of data and tried to deal with the real world, with potential goals of the real world.
We need theories about recipients that we can pass or <unk>
To get to theories about goals.
There are no number of thousands of goals in that area.
It basically boils down to the nuclear power plant of <unk> and the <unk> plant.
So I said to my <unk> <unk> a list of all the experts in <unk> and power plants between our <unk>
I called them up, and I would meet them in an effort for <unk> their experience with what we find in code and data.
And it worked pretty well.
So we were able to associate the little digital <unk> with the control of the <unk>
<unk> is that mobile part inside the <unk> that black object you see.
If you run the speed of this <unk> you can actually <unk> and even make the <unk> explode.
What we also saw is that the goal of the attack was to do it slow, and it was an obvious effort to go back to the nest engineers so that they couldn't solve this quickly.
We try to figure out the big digital <unk> looking at very close to the data and their structures.
So for example, the number <unk> <unk> <unk> in that code, you can't afford it.
So I started looking at scientific literature on how these <unk> are built in <unk> and found that they're <unk> in what's called a <unk> and every waterfall has <unk> <unk>
That made sense, there was a coincidence.
And it got better yet.
These <unk> in Iran are <unk> in 15 parts called stages.
And guess what we find in the <unk> code.
A almost <unk> structure.
So again, that was a good coincidence.
This gave us a lot of confidence in understanding what we had in our hands.
So that it wasn't like this.
The results have been taken after several weeks of hard work.
<unk> <unk> in dead ends.
Even so, we found that both digital <unk> would be a single goal, but from different perspectives.
The small <unk> is taking a <unk> and making the <unk> and <unk> and the big <unk> communicates with six water and manipulating <unk>
In <unk> we're very confident that we've determined what the <unk> is.
It's <unk> and it's just <unk>
We don't need to worry about other targets are <unk> by <unk>
So here I show you some very interesting things that we saw really <unk>
That's the gray box and the top of you see the <unk>
What this thing does is <unk> the input values of input sensors and the vibration sensors and <unk> <unk> which still runs during the attack, with false data.
And believe it or not, these fake input data is <unk> by <unk>
It's like in the Hollywood movies where, for the <unk> the safety camera feeds in <unk> video.
It's great <unk>
The idea here is obviously not only <unk> the operators in the middle of control.
It's really much more dangerous and <unk>
The idea is <unk> a digital security system.
We need digital security systems where a human operator could not play fast.
For example, in a power plant, when the large steam turbine is going on speed, you have to open up valves in a <unk>
Obviously, this can't make it a human operator, right?
That's where we need digital security systems.
And when they're <unk> then you can spend bad things.
The plant can exploit.
And we don't have the <unk> no security system <unk>
That scares it.
But it can be worse.
What I'm going to say is very important.
Think about this. This attack is <unk>
There's nothing to see, specifically, with <unk> with <unk> <unk>
It could work also, for example, in a power plant, or in a <unk> factory.
It's <unk>
And you don't have <unk> <unk> that disseminate this burden with a <unk> <unk> as we saw in the case of <unk>
You could also use the conventional technology of worms to <unk>
We were able to make it as much as possible.
And if you made that, with what we <unk> is with a <unk> of mass destruction.
That's the consequence we have to face.
Unfortunately, the largest number of targets for such is not in the Middle East.
It's in the United States and in Japan.
All the green areas are very much <unk>
We need to face the consequences, and better than we start to prepare now.
Thank you.
Chris Anderson: I have a question.
<unk> has been public in many sides that people assume that <unk> is the main entity behind this.
What's your <unk>
Ralph <unk> Okay, really want to hear this?
Yeah. <unk>
My view is that <unk> is involved, but the engine is not <unk>
The engine behind this is the <unk>
There's one alone and that's the United States, fortunately, <unk>
Because, otherwise our problems would be even larger.
CA: Thank you for <unk> Thank you, <unk>
I want you to imagine a robot that you can take and give it to the <unk> skills or another one that makes you from wheels will raise and go back to walk.
In <unk> <unk> we call these robots, <unk>
It's nothing different than something that's put in the morning, gives you a great force -- which is also increasing its speed, and helps you for example, to manage the balance.
It's actually the real integration of man and the machine.
But not only that -- it can integrate it and connect it with the universe and other <unk> things.
This is not a <unk> idea.
To show you now what we're working on, we begin to talk about the American soldier who, on average, has to take on their back a <unk> load of 45 pounds, and it's <unk> to take even more team.
Obviously, this leads to some important complications -- injuries on your back, at 30 percent of the soldiers -- with chronic damage on my back.
We decided to look at this challenge and create a exoskeleton that could help handle the matter.
Let me introduce you to the <unk> -- or <unk> <unk> Human Human
Soldier: With the exoskeleton <unk> I can save you 90 pounds of land land for many hours.
Its flexible design, it allows you to put in <unk> <unk> and run <unk>
I mean, what I want to do, or where I want to go, and then it increases my strength and my resistance.
<unk>
I mean, it's a reality.
Let's go back to the users of chairs of wheels, about what I feel particularly <unk>
There are 68 million people -- roughly, in folding chairs around the world.
Like one percent of the total population.
And this is a really conservative.
We talk about something that happens often with very young people, with damage to the column that when they start their life -- to 20, 30 or 40 years -- collide with a wall and the wheelchair turns out to be their only option.
We also talk about the population that gets <unk> quickly.
And its only option, many times -- for a brain injury or some other complication -- is the wheelchair.
And this has been this for the last 500 years, from their successful <unk> as I should recognize.
So we decided to start by writing a new chapter about mobility.
Let me introduce you to the <unk> which is using Amanda <unk> who was 19 years ago who was 19 years ago, and as a result, he couldn't go back for 19 years to now.
Amanda <unk> Thank you.
EB: Amanda is using our <unk> that <unk>
It has <unk>
Not <unk> in the crutches that send signals to the computer that send signals to board, here on the back.
There are also a battery here that give you energy to the motors in the <unk> and at the knees, and they do it with this soft and very natural <unk>
AB: I was 24 years on the top of my life when, for a strange jump in the air, skiing down it was <unk>
In a fraction of a second, I lost all feeling and all the whole movement <unk>
Shortly later, a doctor went into my room in the hospital, and he said, <unk> you'll never walk <unk>
That was 19 years ago.
So she stole me to the last hint of hope of my being.
The technology of adapting since then, has allowed me to learn to <unk> it costs the bottom of the rocks and even building rocks and even ride into a <unk>
But they haven't invented anything that allowed me to walk, until now.
Thank you.
EB: As you can see, we have the technology, we have the platforms to sit and talk to you.
It's in our hands, and we have all the potential here to change the lives of future generations -- not just from soldiers, but Amanda, and all the users of the wheels, all of us.
AB: Thank you.
I just returned from a community that has the secret to human survival.
It's a place where women have the <unk> they practice sex to say hello, and play is the order of the day -- where fun is serious.
And no, it's not the festival. <unk> festival.
Ladies and gentlemen, you know about their cousins.
This is the world of the wild Bonobos in the rainforests of Congo.
The bonobos are, along with the chimpanzees, their living relatives closest to them.
That means that we all share a common ancestor an evolutionary ancestor, that lived about about six million years ago.
Now, chimpanzees are known for their <unk>
But unfortunately, we've made too much emphasis on our narratives of human evolution.
But the bonobos show us the other side of the coin.
Whereas the chimps are dominated by big, <unk> society is in charge of females with power.
These guys have created something special because this leads to a very tolerant society, where deadly violence is still not observed yet.
But unfortunately, the bonobos are the least <unk> of the great apes.
They live in the depths of the forest, and it's been very difficult to <unk>
The Congo is a <unk> a land of extraordinary biodiversity and beauty, but also the heart of <unk> <unk> scenario of a violent conflict, which has been prolonged for decades and caused nearly as many deaths like the First World War.
No wonder that this destruction is also placed in danger of the Bonobo.
<unk> trade and deforestation do you can't fill or a stadium with the bonobos in the world -- and honestly, we're not sure about it.
However, in this land of violence and chaos you can hear the laughter hidden from the trees.
Who are these <unk>
We know them like the ape <unk> the love, not the <unk> because they have <unk> sex, <unk> and <unk> to manage conflict and solve social problems.
I'm not saying that this is the solution to all the problems of humanity because the life of Bonobos is more than <unk> <unk>
<unk> like humans, love to play throughout their life.
Play is not just a child's game.
For us and for them the game is critical to establish links and foster <unk>
We learn how to learn, and we learn the rules of the game.
Play increases creativity and resilience and has to do with the generation of <unk> diversity of interactions, diversity of connections.
And when you look at the polio game, you see the roots, the same points of laughter, the dance and the human ritual and human ritual as you look at.
The game is the glue that comes to us.
I don't know how you play -- but I want to show you a couple of unique videos taken from the wild.
First, it's a <unk> <unk> game, and I don't talk about football.
Here we have a female and a young male in the middle of a <unk>
Look at what she is.
It could be the evolutionary origin of the phrase: <unk> <unk> <unk>
I just think in this case, he loves him, isn't it?
Yeah.
So sexual play is common as well as humans.
And this video really is interesting because I think, this video really is interesting because it shows the invention of bringing things unusual elements into play, like <unk> and also how play requires trust and <unk> <unk> and at the same time it's more fun.
But play is <unk>
The game is <unk> it can take a lot of ways -- some of which are more <unk> <unk> -- maybe the place where wonder.
And I want you to <unk> this is <unk> a young female -- which is playing with a <unk> water.
I think that as it is, sometimes we play ourselves, and we explore the limits of our interior and outside of our inner worlds.
And it's that playful curiosity that drives us to explore, interact. And then the unexpected connections that we form are the actual <unk> of creativity.
These are just little samples of the realization that Bonobos give us from our past and present.
But they also have a secret to our future, a future that we need to adapt to a more and harder world with greater creativity and greater cooperation.
The secret is that play is the key to these abilities.
In other words, play is our <unk> of <unk>
To adapt to a world that changes need to play.
But let's get to the most of our model capacity.
The game is not <unk>
The game is critical.
For Bonobos and humans alike, life is not just cruel and <unk>
When it seems to be at least appropriate to play, you can be the most urgent moments of it.
So for that, fellow primates, we accept this gift of evolution and <unk> together as a creativity -- creativity, friendship and wonder.
Thank you.
In New York I'm responsible for a nonprofit organization called Robin <unk>
When I'm not fighting poverty, <unk> fires as a captain as a captain in a <unk> body.
And in our city, where volunteers are dominating a highly skilled staff -- you have to get to the fire site very soon to go into action.
I remember my first fire.
I was the second volunteer on the site, so I had a pretty high probability of it.
But there was still a career on the top of the volunteers to get to the captain and find out which was our task.
When I found the <unk> I was <unk> in a conversation with the owner that has certainly gone through one of the worst days of his life.
We were at full night, she was standing outside in the rain, under a <unk> <unk> while his house was on fire.
The other volunteer that I had just got to get before me, <unk> <unk> <unk> --  first to the captain and he asked him to fit and would save the dog <unk> dog.
<unk> I was <unk> <unk>
There was a lawyer or a <unk> of money that, during the rest of his life, I would have to tell the people that I entered a building into a call to save a live living because I won for five seconds.
Well, I was the next one.
The captain made me a <unk>
He said, <unk> I need to be at the house.
I need you to say, <unk> fire, and I bring this woman a couple shoes in.
I <unk>
It wasn't exactly what I hoped but I was going on the stairs, at the end of the hall, I went to the <unk> in the order of the hall, went to the <unk> and I walked down to the top room for a couple shoes.
I know what you're thinking, but I'm not a hero.
I took my load back through the staircase where I met my <unk> and the beautiful dog in the front door.
We got out of the house the treasures for the house owner where, as you would expect, her trove got much more attention than mine.
A few weeks later the department received a letter from the house owner <unk> by the brave effort to save her home.
The kindness that she looked at on the other was someone had achieved even a pair of shoes.
Both on my calling in Robin <unk> like my calling as a volunteer -- I'm considering acts of generosity and kindness on a <unk> scale, but also acts of grace and courage to <unk>
And you know what I've learned?
Everything has its importance.
So when I look at this room to people who have achieved, or are there by <unk> remarkable levels of success I'd like to remind you -- not wait.
Don't wait to win the first million to make the difference in somebody's life.
If you have something to give, <unk> now.
They took food in a dining room, a neighborhood park.
They're mentors.
Not every day we're going to have the opportunity to save somebody's life, but each day we're going to be able to influence someone.
So we trained the <unk> <unk> the shoes.
Thank you.
Bruno Giussani: Mark, he comes back.
Mark <unk> Thank you.
This may seem strange, but I'm a big fan of the concrete block.
The first concrete blocks built in <unk> with a very simple idea, modules from a fixed measure that fit together with each other.
Very quickly, these became the most used building unit in the world.
They have allowed us to build things larger than us, like buildings or bridges, a brick at the time.
Essentially, these blocks have become the pillars of our time.
Almost a hundred years later, in 1947, <unk> came up with this.
It was called a brick of assembly <unk>
And in a few years, the <unk> blocks came to all the homes.
It's estimated that over 400 billion or 75 blocks per person on the planet.
You don't have to be an engineer to build beautiful bridges, buildings or home.
<unk> made it accessible.
<unk> simply adopted the concrete block, the favorite in the world, and it turned it into a fundamental piece of our imagination.
Meanwhile, exactly that same year, in the Bell labs, the next revolution was about to <unk> the new building block.
The transistor was a small unit of plastic that would take us from a world of aesthetic bricks surrounded each other to a world where everything was interactive.
Just like the concrete block, the transistor allows to create a much bigger circuits and more complex, a brick at the time.
But there's a <unk> difference. The transistor was just for experts.
I am personally not going to tell you that the building blocks of our time are reserved to experts, so I decided to change it.
Eight years ago, when I was at the Media Lab, I began to explore the idea of bringing the power of engineers to the hands of artists and designers.
A few years ago, I started developing <unk>
I'm going to show you how they work.
<unk> are electronics each one with a specific function.
They're <unk> to be light, sound, engines and sensors.
And the best thing about everything is that they join through magnets.
So you can't place the wrong way.
<unk> have a code of color.
The green is the <unk> the blue is the stream, the rose is the input and the orange color is <unk>
So you only have to assemble a blue with a green one, and very quickly you can start to make bigger circuits.
A blue one with one green you make light.
Can we put a button in the environment, and we have a <unk>
If we change the button for a pulse, which is here, and now we have a light <unk>
And we put this <unk> to create more impact and we have a noise.
I'm going to stop this.
So beyond the simple game, <unk> are actually very powerful.
Instead of having to <unk> connect and <unk> <unk> allows us to program using very simple gestures.
To make <unk> faster or slower and slow down, just turn this button that makes the pulse faster or slower.
The idea behind <unk> is that it's a collection growing.
We want all of the interactions in the world to look at bricks and ready to use.
<unk> sounds, solar panels must be accessible.
We've given kids to see them playing with them.
And it's been an incredible experience.
The best thing is how you start to understand the electronics of every day that you don't learn in schools.
For instance, how a light of light works, or why the door of an elevator gets open, or how an iPod responds to touch.
We've also led to design schools.
So for example, designers without some electronic experience start to play with <unk> as a material.
Here you can see, with paper bottles and <unk> we have <unk> <unk>
<unk>  A few weeks ago, we took <unk> to the design School of Rhode Island, which has no experience in engineering, wood and paper and paper and said, Make something for you.
Here's an example of a project that has made a <unk> <unk> <unk>
But wait, here's my favorite project.
It's a made of dough that is made out of the darkness.
For these not engineers, <unk> became another material, electronics became another material.
And we want this material to be all the time.
And so, <unk> has open code.
You can visit the website, download all the design files and <unk>
We want to encourage a world of creators, inventors and collaborators because this world we live, this interactive world is ours.
So go ahead and <unk>
Thank you.
Today I'm going to talk to you about unexpected discoveries.
I work in the solar technology industry.
And my little company is looking for to get involved with the environment focused on the environment.
<unk> collaboration.
This is a little video of what we do.
<unk> Wait for a moment.
You can take a little bit of <unk>
We can continue better we leave the video on one side.
No.
This is not ...
All right.
Technology is ...
Oh, I'm going to be a term on time?
Okay. Thank you very much.
A couple years ago, I launched a initiative to recruit the best designers and technical so that they take a year and work in an environment that represents almost everything that is supposed to work on the government.
The initiative was called <unk> for <unk> and it would be like about <unk> Peace <unk>
<unk> a few members every year and put them working with the <unk>
Instead of sending them to Third World world we send them to the wild world.
They made great <unk> worked with <unk> employees worked with them.
Their task is to show the possibilities of today's technology.
So meet <unk>
It's a hydrant in the city in Boston.
Here it appears as if I look at a date, but what you really look for is someone to clean up when it stays on the snow -- because you know it's not very good when it gets fires when it's covered by a meter of snow.
How did it come to ask for help from this so <unk>
Last year in Boston we had a team of members for <unk>
They were there in February and at that moment, we were very much last year.
They realized that the city never wiped out these <unk>
But one of the members called Erik <unk> noticed something else: that citizens <unk> with <unk> sidewalks just in front of them.
So he did like any good programmer, I developed an application.
It's a nice application where you can take a <unk>
You take <unk> when you <unk>
When you do that, you put a name, in this case, he put him <unk>
If you don't do it, somebody can <unk>
I mean, it has a component.
It's a modest application.
Maybe it's the tiniest <unk> app last year.
But does something that no other technology of government <unk>
And it spreads in the viral.
A responsible for systems of <unk> City systems to see this application realized that I could use it, not for the snow, but for the citizens to have <unk> <unk>
It's very important to work for these <unk> of tsunami, but people steal the batteries.
That's why citizens who were <unk>
And then Seattle decided to use it to make the citizens <unk> the <unk> <unk>
And Chicago just <unk> to make people stand up to clean sidewalks when they were born.
So now we know about nine cities that plan to use it.
And this has been spread without <unk> and natural <unk>
If you know a little bit of government technology, you know that this doesn't usually happen.
The software acquisition is usually a couple of years.
Last year in Boston we had a team working on a project that took three people for two and a half months.
It was a tool for parents to choose the best public school for their children.
Then they told us that I had done by normal channels would have taken at least two and side about two million dollars.
And that's nothing.
Now there is a project in the power of California that all the way down to two billion dollars and it doesn't work.
And there are projects like this on every level of government.
So an application that shows in a couple of days and it spreads in viral form is a kind of warning shot for the institution of the government.
It suggests the government better ways to work, not as a lot of people who think it should be.
Not as a technological company, but rather like the Internet.
I mean, without constraints, in open and <unk>
And that's important.
But the most important thing about this application is that it represents the way we tackle the government of government that has the new <unk> not as a problem of an institution, but as a collective action problem.
And that's very good because it turns out we're very good for the collective action with digital technology.
And there is a very large community of people who are building the tools so that we can engage together with efficacy.
And it's not only <unk> for <unk> but there are hundreds of people around the country that contribute to <unk> applications every day in their own communities.
You haven't given the government.
Do you feel a great frustration that we don't have to do, but they didn't have the <unk>
And these people know something that we've lost in sight.
And it is that if we leave the feelings of politics, the row in the <unk> <unk> <unk> and all those other things that they get crazy -- the government is essentially in the words of Tim <unk> "What we do together because we alone don't know.
Now, a lot of people have abandoned government.
If you are one of those people, I would ask you to do it because things are changing.
The policy doesn't react the government.
And because the government ultimately <unk> <unk> -- remember that <unk> the <unk> The way of thinking about it will affect the way of making change.
I didn't know a lot of government when I started with this.
And as a lot of people thought the government was to pick up people so that they were <unk>
Well, after two years, I've come to the conclusion that the government is, mostly of <unk>
This is the heart care center of services and information.
It's the place that the calls is if you brand <unk> in the U.S.
Scott <unk> this call.
<unk> <unk> at the base of official knowledge.
I found nothing. It started with animal control.
And finally he said, "Hey, you can open the gates of the house, and put music very strong and see if you were <unk>
And it worked. So well by Scott.
But that was not the end of the <unk>
Boston doesn't have a phone center.
It has a <unk> web and mobile, called <unk> <unk>
We don't want that application.
It was the work of very smart people from the Office of New York <unk> in Boston.
One day, this really happened -- it actually comes to this <unk> <unk> in my bucket of trash. I don't know if it's dead.
How do I do for <unk>
The dynamic of <unk> <unk> is different.
Scott was talking in person.
In <unk> <unk> everything is public, so everybody can see this.
In this case, he saw a neighbor.
The next report said, "I went up to the place, I found the bucket of garbage behind the house.
<unk> Yes. <unk> Yes.
I went home. I went home.
Good nights, sweet <unk>
Quite simple.
This is great. It's the confluence of digital and physical.
And it's also a great example of the income of the government to the continuous distributed collaboration.
But it's also a great example of government as a platform.
And I'm not necessarily talking about the definition of the platform.
I'm talking about a platform for people to <unk> and help others.
So, a citizen helped another but here the government had a key role.
connected to two people.
And it could have been connected to the government services of being necessary, but the neighbor is a better and cheaper alternative than government services.
When one neighbor helps another one, they get the communities.
If we call the control control, that costs a lot of money.
One important thing we need to think about the government is that it's not the same as politics.
A lot of people understand it, but they think that one is the input of the other.
That our input to the government system is <unk>
How many times have you chosen to be a political leader, sometimes we spend a lot of energy to choose a new political leader and then we hope that the government to bring our values and solve our values, but then we don't see changes.
That's because the government is like an immense ocean and politics is the <unk> <unk> layer.
That's what we call <unk>
And we say that word with a lot of contempt.
But it's that <unk> which keeps us that that we funded as something that we funded in our against, that other thing, and in consequence we're losing power.
People believe that politics is sexy.
If we want this institution to work that we will have to make the bureaucracy as much sexy.
Because it's where the real job of government.
We need to collaborate with the machinery of government.
That makes the movement <unk>
They've been <unk>
It's a group of citizen citizens who have written a very detailed report of 325 pages in response to the <unk> <unk> of <unk> on the financial reform project.
That's not political activism is <unk>
And for those of us who have been asked to government is time to ask us what world we want to leave our children.
You have to see the huge challenges that they will have to face.
Do you really think we get to go without solving the institution that can act on behalf of all?
We can't afford the government, we need to be more effective.
The good news is that with technology is possible to rethink the function of government so that it can expand to the civil society.
There's a generation that grew up with the Internet and knows it's not that difficult to act <unk> you only have to articulate systems in the right way.
The average age of our members is 28 years so I am, so I <unk> I'm a bigger generation that many of them.
This is a generation that has grown up by taking the word and giving that almost granted.
They're not giving that battle that everybody is going to talk, everybody will talk.
They can express your opinions in any channel at the same time and they do.
So when you face the government problem, you don't care much to hear their voices.
They're using your hands.
They bring the hands to the work to program applications that do better work for the government.
And those applications allow us to use our hands to improve our communities.
It can be clean up a <unk> taking out of them, pulling up a bucket of garbage on the inside.
Of course, we were always able to <unk> those <unk> and a lot of people do.
But these applications are like digital <unk> that we're not only consumers -- we're not only consumers of government we pay and we get services.
We are more than that: we're citizens.
And we're not going to fix the government until we don't have the <unk>
So I want to ask everybody here, when it comes to the important things that we have to do together, all together, we'll be a crowd of voices, or also we'll be a crowd of hands?
Thank you.
This is for me a real honor.
I've spent most of the time in prisons, prisons and death row.
I've spent most of my life in <unk> communities in projects and places where there's a lot of despair.
And I'm here at TED watching and hearing these stimulus have given me a lot of energy.
One of the things that I noticed in this short time is that TED has identity.
And the things that are told here are impact around the world.
Sometimes, if something comes from TED, it has a sense and a force that would not have another way.
I say this because I think identity is <unk> important.
So here we've seen fantastic presentations.
And I think we've learned that the words of a teacher can make a lot of sense, but if they teach them with feeling, they can have a special meaning,
A doctor can do good things, <unk> if it's <unk> it can achieve much more.
So I want to talk about the power of identity.
I didn't really learn this in the practice of the law, my job.
I learned from my grandmother.
I grew up in a traditional African-American home, dominated by a <unk> which was my grandmother.
It was <unk> it was strong, he had power.
It was the last word in all discussion in the family.
She <unk> many of the <unk> in our home.
He was a daughter of people who had been slaves.
His parents were born in slavery in Virginia <unk>
She was born on the <unk> and his experience with slavery -- <unk> the way the world looked like.
She was <unk> but it was also <unk>
When I was a little boy, I looked at it, and I was approaching me and gave me a good embrace.
I got so hard that I could barely breathe and then let me.
One or two hours later, I went back to me, and I was going to say, <unk> you still feel my <unk>
And if I told him that no, I went back again and if I said yes, I would leave me in peace.
I had this human quality that would always wish you to be close to it.
The only problem is that I had 10 children.
My mother was the lower 10.
At occasion, when I was going to spend a time with it, it wasn't easy to get their time and your attention.
My cousins were running around everywhere.
I remember when I was eight or nine years old, I woke up one morning, I went to the room and there were all my cousins.
My grandmother was on the other side of the room and looked at me <unk>
I thought it was a game.
And then he looked at it, and she goes, but she was very serious.
After 15 or 20 minutes, she stood up through the room, he took me out of his hand, and he said, "Come on! So we're both going to <unk>
I remember this as if it was yesterday.
I'll never forget it.
He took me out and said, "You know, I'll tell you something, but you can't tell anyone to tell you."
I said, "It's okay, <unk>
She said, "Now it was <unk> I said, <unk>
Then I sat down, I looked at me and said, "I want you to know that I've been <unk>
And <unk> <unk> that you're <unk>
He said, "I think you can do what you <unk>
I'll never forget it.
Then he said, "I just want you to tell me three things, <unk>
I said, <unk> <unk>
And he said, "I first want your mother."
<unk> "She is my <unk> and you have to <unk> that always <unk>
As I was interviewing my mom, I said, "Yes, <unk> so <unk>
Then he said to me, "The second I want you to do, is that you will always do the right thing even though the right thing is <unk>
I thought, "Yes, <unk> So <unk>
And then finally, he said, "The third thing I want you to tell me, is that you never <unk> <unk>
I was nine years old, and I said, "Yes, <unk>
I grew up in the field, in rural City, I have a brother a younger year and a sister a year.
When I was 14 -- 15, one day my brother came home with a <unk> package I don't know where the <unk> took me to my sister and I went and went to the forest.
We are just doing the <unk> of the usual <unk>
He took a taste of beer, offered my sister, she took a little and offered me to me.
I said, "No, no, no. It's okay. You know, but I'm not going to take <unk>
My brother said, <unk> Today, and you always do the same thing as us.
I already took something, your sister as well. Take a <unk>
I said, "No. I wouldn't feel good. You can <unk>
And then my brother looked at me.
And he said, "What's going on? Take a <unk>
He went into the <unk> and <unk> "Oh, I'm not going to be that you're still thinking about the conversation with <unk>
I said, "But what are you talking about?"
He said, <unk> tells all the grandchildren that are <unk>
I was <unk>
I have to admit something to you.
I'll tell you something that I probably shouldn't say.
I know this is spread <unk>
But I have 52 years and I can admit I've never taken a drop of alcohol.
I don't mean this thinking that it's a <unk> I say it for the power that has the identity.
When we create the right kind of identity, we say things to others who really don't make it sense.
We can't get them to do things that don't believe being able to do.
I think my grandmother naturally believed that all his grandchildren were special.
My grandfather had been a prisoner during the <unk>
My whooping died of age-related diseases.
And these were the things that it was, according to it, we need to get it out.
Now, trying to talk about our criminal justice system.
This country is today very different than what was 40 years ago.
In <unk> there were 300,000 prisoners.
There are 2.3 million.
In the United States we have the largest incarceration rate in the world.
We have seven million people in parole.
And this mass incarceration, in my opinion, has fundamentally changed our world.
In poor communities or black communities, you find so much <unk> so much despair, determined by these facts.
One of every three black men between 18 and 30 years is in jail or parole.
In the urban <unk> across the country, L.A., Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Washington, Washington, 50 to 60 percent of all young people are in jail or parole.
Our system is not only distorted in front of race, it's also about poverty.
In this country we have a judicial system that comes to you much better if you're rich and guilty.
It's not <unk> but wealth affects the results.
And it seems to be very <unk>
<unk> politics and anger make us believe that these are not a problem of ours.
We are <unk>
I think it's interesting.
We're looking at our work at some curious developments in our work.
In my state, in Alabama, as well as other states, you love rights for always if you have a criminal <unk>
Right now, in Alabama, the <unk> of the black male population has definitely lost the right to vote.
And if we put it to the next 10 years the level of the loss of rights to be as high as it was before you had a law law to vote.
We have this awesome silence.
I represent children.
Many of my customers are very young.
America is the only country in the world where it's sentence at 13 year to die in prison.
We have this country jail for children, no possibility of getting out.
Now we're in the process of some <unk>
The only country in the world.
We were asking people in the death row.
This issue of death penalty is interesting.
In a sense of sense, they've been <unk> to think that the final question is, people deserve to die by the <unk> <unk>
A very sensitive question.
But you can think of another way about how we are in our identity.
There's another way of <unk> it's not about deciding whether people deserve to die for <unk> crimes but if we deserve to kill.
This is interesting.
The death penalty in America is defined by error.
At every nine people -- <unk> has identified one which is innocent who is <unk> and liberated from death row.
It's a mistake, <unk> an innocent one in nine.
This is interesting.
In aviation it wouldn't ever be allowed to fly airplanes if every nine that <unk> one would be <unk>
But somehow we get rid of the problem.
It's not our problem.
It's not our charge.
It's not our fight.
I talk a lot about these things.
I'm talking about race and this issue of if we deserve to kill.
It's interesting that in my classes with students on <unk> <unk> I talk about slavery today.
I talk about terrorism, the time that started at the end of the rebuilding and that lasted to World War II.
We really don't know much about this.
But for the black Americans in this country, was a very defined time by terror.
In many communities people were afraid to be <unk>
They were worried about being <unk>
The terror threat was what defined their lives.
Now there are people older people who come up to me and say, "Mr. Stevenson, you tell me and makes people say that you stop saying that in our history with the first time with terrorism, after the <unk>
They ask me to say, "No. <unk> that we grew up with that."
This was the terrorism era, obviously, with segregation and decades of <unk> racial and separation.
In this country we have a dynamic why we don't like to talk about our problems.
We don't like to talk about our story.
And that's why we haven't understood the meaning of what we've historically done.
All of the time we had with each other.
We are constantly creating tensions and conflict.
It costs us work to talk about races. I think it's because we're not willing to engage with a process of truth and reconciliation.
In South Africa, people understood that they couldn't overcome race without a commitment to truth and reconciliation.
In Rwanda, even before genocide had this commitment, but in this country we haven't done it.
I was in Germany giving talks about death row.
It was fascinating because one of the teachers stood after my presentation and said, "You know it's OK to listen to what you <unk>
<unk> "We don't have death row in Germany.
We can never get it here."
The room stayed silently and a lady said, "There is no way with our history, we can never get into the systematic death of human beings.
It would be irrational than us <unk> and <unk> and <unk> to <unk>
So let's tell you about this.
How would we feel that in a world where a nation like Germany, <unk> people, especially if they were in their majority <unk>
We couldn't afford it.
It would be irrational.
And yet, there's this disconnection.
I think our identity is in danger.
If we actually don't really care about these difficult issues, the positive and wonderful things they are, however, <unk>
We love innovation.
We are fascinated by technology, <unk> creativity.
We love entertainment.
But lately, those realities are <unk> by suffering, the <unk> the <unk>
In my opinion, you need to integrate both things.
We've been talking about the need to have more hope, more commitment, more dedication with the basic challenges of this complex world.
I think that's going to be spending more time thinking and talking about the poor, the <unk> that they never come to TED.
Think of them is, in a way, something that's inside our self.
We have to believe in issues that we haven't seen.
So we are. In spite of being so rational, so committed to intellectual things.
With innovation, development comes not just the brain ideas.
These things come from <unk> ideas also by the convictions of the heart.
This connection of mind with the heart is what drives us to look at not just the bright and <unk> but also as dark and hard.
<unk> <unk> the great leader <unk> talking about this.
He said, "When we were in East Europe suffering from the <unk> we wanted all sorts of things, but mainly what we needed was hope, orientation for spirit, a will to be in places of despair and being <unk>
Well, that orientation for the spirit is pretty much at the heart of what I think, even in communities like TED, has <unk>
There is no disconnect related to technology and design, that allowed us to be truly human if we don't pay attention to poverty, the <unk> of inequality, to injustice.
Now I want to warn you that these thoughts are a much more challenging identity than if we ignore these things.
We go back to <unk>
I had the great privilege, being a very young lawyer from meeting Rosa <unk>
These women were together just to speak.
Occasionally, I was called to me, to say, <unk> comes the <unk> We're going to get together to speak.
Do you want to come and <unk>
I said, "Yes, lady. I know <unk>
So she said, "Well, what do you do when you <unk>
I read <unk>
So I was going and just <unk>
It was very <unk> very <unk>
And on one occasion, I was there, listening to these <unk> and after a couple hours, Ms. Parks was headed to me and said, "Now, <unk> Give me this idea of criminal justice.
<unk> what you're trying to do."
And I started to give me my speech.
I said, "Well, we're trying to question injustice.
We try to help those who have been doomed unfairly.
We try to confront prejudice and discrimination in management of criminal justice.
We try to end up with a life sentences without freedom <unk> for children.
We try to do something about death penalty.
We try to reduce the population in prisons.
We try to end up with <unk> <unk>
I gave everything my best speech and then I looked at me and said, <unk> <unk> <unk>
And <unk> <unk> very <unk>
At the time, Mrs. <unk> got a finger on the face and said, "This is why you have to be very <unk>
I think actually, the TED community has to be much more <unk>
We need to find ways to deal with those challenges, that problems, that suffering.
Because eventually humanity depends on compassion for others.
I've learned some very simple things in my work.
I've been educated in simple things.
I've come to understand and to believe that each of us is higher than the worst thing we have ever met.
I think that's true for everybody on the planet.
I'm convinced if somebody tells a lie, it's not because it's a liar.
I'm sure if somebody takes something that doesn't belong to you, it's not a <unk>
Even if somebody kills another, it's not a <unk>
This is why I think there's a basic dignity in people who should be <unk> by the law.
I also believe that in many parts of this country and certainly in many parts of the world, the opposite of poverty is not wealth.
That's not.
I really think that in many parts of poverty is justice.
And finally, I think that even though it's very <unk> very <unk> very <unk> we will not judge us for our technology, for our designs, not for our intellectual or rational.
At the end of the end is <unk> the character of a society -- not because of the way rich and powerful people, but because of the way they treat poor, they sell them to prisoners.
Because it's in this context as we started to understand truly profound issues about what we are.
Sometimes I feel <unk> I'm going to end with a story.
I sometimes do too much force.
<unk> tired, just like all.
Sometimes those ideas go beyond my ideas in a important way.
I've been representing these guys who have been convicted of a lot of <unk>
I'm going to jail and I see my clients from 13 and 14 years old, which have been <unk> for adults as adults as adults.
And I start thinking, how can it be?
How can a judge turn someone into what it isn't it?
The judge was <unk> as an adult, but I see a kid.
One night very late I was awake in my God, if the judge can turn you into something you don't are, you should have magical powers.
Yeah, <unk> the judge has magical powers.
You should ask something about that.
As I was very late, I couldn't think right, but I started working on a <unk>
I had a <unk> <unk> a small, poor, black.
I started working on the <unk> with a <unk> who said, <unk> for my black customer in 14 years is treated like a privileged white <unk> executive from a <unk>
In the <unk> I put there there had been <unk> behavior, in the <unk> of the police and in the process.
There was a <unk> line about how in this country there is no ethics, but a lack of ethics.
The next morning, I woke up thinking that <unk> would be a dream, or really the <unk>
For my horror, not only had it, but he had sent it to court.
It took about two months, I had forgotten it.
And finally <unk> Oh my God, I have to go to court for this case, stupid.
I got into the car and I felt really <unk> <unk>
I went in the car to court.
I thought this would be very difficult and <unk>
I finally dropped out of the car.
I was going up the stairs when I met a black man -- he was the <unk> of the courthouse.
When he saw me, he came up and he said, "Who is you?"
I said, "I'm a <unk> He said, "It's you <unk> I said yes.
And so I came up and came up with me.
And I <unk> in the ear, in the ear, in the ear, to me.
He said, "I'm proud of <unk>
I have to tell you now that that was <unk>
That was deeply connected with my interior, with my identity with the ability that we all have to contribute to the community with a vision of hope.
Well, I went into <unk>
When the judge saw me saw me.
And he said, "Mr. Stevenson, you wrote this audacity <unk>
I said, "Be Mr. <unk> And we started argue.
People started there. They were all <unk>
I was the one that had written these crazy things.
They got the cops the prosecutors <unk> <unk>
Suddenly, without knowing how, the room was full of people. We were all mad because we are talking about poverty, because we talked about poverty, because we talked about inequality.
With the <unk> eye, I got to see the <unk> which was going and <unk>
I would look at the window and let them hear all that <unk>
I kept walking over here and for there.
Finally, this old black black, with the face of concern, he entered the room and sat behind me, almost at the table of lawyers.
About 10 minutes later, the judge <unk> a <unk>
During the break a <unk> <unk> showed me as well because the <unk> had entered the room.
The assistant <unk> over the old black man.
And he said, <unk> what do you do in the <unk> room.
And the old black man stood up, looked at me and he looked at me and said, "You know, this guy from audiences to tell this young man to keep her view in the goal with <unk>
I have come today to TED because I think many of you understand that the moral bow of the universe is very big, but it folds into justice.
That we can't truly be <unk> if we don't care about human rights and for dignity.
That our survival is linked to each other.
That our visions of technology, design and creativity must be <unk> to the <unk> <unk> and justice.
And above all, those of us here who share this, I just want to tell you that keep the view in the goal with <unk>
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: <unk> to hear and see an obvious desire in the audience of this community, to help in your purposes of doing something.
Something that's not a <unk> What can we do?
<unk> There are several opportunities.
If you live in California, for instance, there will be a <unk> this spring in which it will be a <unk> effort to make the funds that you spend today in politics policies.
For instance, here in California, you're going to spend a billion dollars in death row in the next five years. One billion dollars.
And despite this, the <unk> of <unk> cases not <unk> in <unk>
<unk> of rapes come to nothing.
Here's an opportunity for change.
This <unk> is going to propose that these funds are going to come up with the law to safety.
I think there's a very close opportunity.
CA: There's been a huge decline in crime in the United States, in the last three decades.
Part of the explanation, you say it has to do with the highest rate of <unk>
What would you say this is this?
<unk> Actually, the crime rate with violence has remained relatively stable.
The big growth in mass <unk> in this country is not crimes with violence.
It's because of the wrong War on drugs.
That's why this dramatic increase in the population of <unk>
And we let us convince the rhetoric of punishment.
We have three legal causes to bring people to the chain -- to steal a bicycle by stealing a bicycle by little crimes against property, instead of making it <unk> those resources to their victims.
I think we need to do more to help the victims of <unk> and not less.
It seems to me that our current philosophy about punishment does nothing for anyone.
I think that's the orientation that has to change.
CA: <unk> you have excited to do today here.
You're very inspiring.
Thank you very much for coming to TED. Thank you.
Announcer: <unk> threats by Bin Laden's death threat.

Oh, my God!
Peter <unk> These are just some of the clips that I got in the last six months -- <unk> could be the last six days or the last six years.
The idea is that the media media would rather be <unk> because our minds pay attention to them.
And that responds to a very good reason.
In every second of our senses, our senses receive a lot more data than probably the brain can <unk>
And as nothing matters to us, the first stop of all of those data is an old fragment of the temporal lobe called the amygdala.
The amygdala is our early warning detector, the <unk>
<unk> and records all the information for something in the environment that could make us hurt.
And so from the <unk> stories of stories -- looking at the results, look at the results.
That old adage of <unk> "If there is blood -- it's very true.
And because all digital devices provide us with negative news, the seven days of the week, 24 hours a day, no wonder we're <unk>
It's not surprising that people think the world will be wrong with worse.
But maybe it's not like that.
Maybe, instead of change, what happens is we get <unk>
Maybe enormous progress done in the last century by a series of forces is <unk> so we have the potential to create a world of abundance in the next three decades.
I'm not saying that we don't have our good problems, climate change, water extinction -- the scarcity of water, and we have no doubt we have.
As human beings are very good at overcoming the problems, and in the long run, we just had them.
Let's take that in the last century to see where we go.
In the last hundred years, the average of life has more than <unk> the average per capita income adjusted by inflation has been <unk> across the world.
Child mortality has reduced 10 times.
In addition, the cost of food and transportation and communications, has fallen from 10 to 1,000 times.
Steve <unk> showed us that we are living the most peaceful time of human history.
And Charles democracies that global literacy country goes 25 to more than 80 percent in the last 130 years.
We're really living in an extraordinary time.
A lot of people forget it.
And we continue to get more and higher expectations every time.
In fact, we redefined the meaning of poverty.
<unk> today in the U.S., a lot of the people who live under the line of poverty, have electricity, water, toilets, television, mobile phones, conditioning and cars.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> the planet -- would never have dreamed of such <unk>
And so much of this is the technology and, lately, its exponential growth.
My good friend of Ray Kurzweil showed that any tool that <unk> information technology jumps into this curve, Moore's Law, and doubling the price of the price for about 12 to 24 months.
So the mobile phone that you have in your pocket is a million times cheaper and a thousand times faster than a supercomputer from the '70s.
Now look at this curve.
It's Moore's Law for the last hundred years.
I want you to look at two things on this curve.
First of all, the soft thing is -- in good and bad times, in war and peace, and recession, of depression and <unk>
It's the resulting of fast computers used to build faster computers.
It doesn't stop any of the big challenges.
And although it's <unk> on a law on the left, it goes up.
The growth rate of technology is actually getting faster.
And on this curve, to <unk> Moore's Law, there's a series of extraordinarily powerful technologies that we have today.
The cloud, the cloud, that my friends of <unk> call infinite computing, sensors and networks, robotics, 3D printing and its ability to democratize <unk> and distribute personalized production, all over the planet, synthetic biology, fuel and food, and the digital medicine, the <unk> and the A.I. and the A.I. and the A.I. and the A.I. and the A.I. and the A.I. and the A.I. and the A.I. and the A.I.
I mean, how many of you saw the victory on "Jeopardy" <unk>
It was <unk>
I looked for the newspapers the best headline I <unk>
And I loved this: This is <unk> <unk>
"Jeopardy" is not an easy game.
<unk> with the <unk> of human language.
Imagine this artificial intelligence in the cloud, available for all of your cell phone.
Four years ago, Ray Kurzweil and I, we launched a new university called <unk> <unk>
We teach these technologies to our students, and in particular, how can you be used to solve the great challenges of humanity.
And every year we asked them to release a company, or a service or service that can affect the lives of a billion people in a decade.
Think about that, the fact that a group of students today can impact a billion people.
Thirty years ago, I would have <unk> absurd.
Today we can point out a <unk> of companies that have already done.
When I think about creating abundance, it doesn't mean to create <unk> life for each one on the planet, is about creating a life of possible.
It's about taking that that is scarce and making it <unk>
You see, scarcity is <unk> and technology is a force that releases resources.
I'll give you an example.
It's a story of <unk> <unk> in the <unk>
He's the guy on the left.
They went to dinner the king of <unk>
<unk> troops ate with covered with silver, and the same <unk> with covered with gold.
But the king of <unk> ate with aluminum <unk>
You see, the aluminum was the most precious metal on the planet, was worth more than gold and <unk>
That's why the tip of the <unk> in Washington is aluminum <unk>
You see, even though aluminum is the <unk> of the mass of the Earth, it doesn't come like <unk>
It's tied by oxygen and <unk>
But then he got the <unk> and he made it so cheap that we use it as if it was <unk>
So let's bring this analogy to the future.
Let's think about the shortage of energy.
Ladies and gentlemen, we are on a planet by 5,000 times more energy than we use in a year.
They come to the Earth 16 <unk> of energy every 88 minutes.
It's not about need, it's about <unk>
And there's good news.
This year, for the first time, the cost of solar energy in India is 50 percent less than the generated by <unk> rupees versus 17 rupees.
The cost of solar power fell 50 percent last year.
Last month, MIT published a study that shows that in the late decade, in the <unk> parts of the United States, solar electricity will cost six cents per hour compared to 15 cents of national average.
And if we have an abundance of energy, we have a abundance of water.
Let's talk about wars in the water.
Do you remember when Carl Sagan pointed the Voyager vessel towards the Earth, in 1990, after <unk>
<unk> a famous picture. How do you <unk>
"A <unk> <unk> <unk>
Because we live on a planet of water.
We live on a planet covered in 70 percent of water.
Yes, <unk> is seawater, the two percent is ice, and we fought for the <unk> of water on the planet, but also here's a hope.
It's a available technology not 10 or 20 years, but right now.
It comes the nanotechnology, the <unk>
In a conversation with Dean Kamen this morning, one of the innovators from the <unk> I would like to share with you, gave me permission to <unk> his technology called <unk> <unk> the <unk> is the size of a little fridge smaller.
It is able to generate 1,000 liters of drinking water by any day of any source of any <unk> water, water -- a <unk> for less than two cents a gallon.
The president of Coca-Cola just realized that I will do a very important test for hundreds of these units in the developing world.
If that comes out right, and I have full confidence that it will be, Coca-Cola will implement the world in <unk> countries on the planet.
This is an ongoing innovation for this technology that is today.
And we've seen it on mobile phones.
My God, we're going to get to 70 percent penetration penetration in the end of the end of 2013.
<unk> that mightiest warrior has better mobile communications in Kenya that the president Reagan 25 years ago.
And from counting with a smart smartphone with Google, it has access to more knowledge and information than President Clinton did 15 years ago.
He lives in a world of information and communications abundance that nobody could have predicted ever.
So better than that, the things that you and I have paid tens and hundreds of thousands of dollars -- <unk> video, images, libraries of books and music, diagnostic technology -- <unk> diagnostic technology now <unk> and they lose market value with mobile phones.
Maybe it gets the best thing to get in health care.
Last month, I had the pleasure of announce with the <unk> Foundation, which is something called the X <unk> <unk> <unk>
We are challenging the teams in the world so that we can take these technologies into a mobile device with the talk, and because it has <unk> you can get <unk> you can get blood from <unk>
To win has to make better diagnoses that a medical team <unk>
Imagine this device in the middle of the developing world in which there are no doctors, where the load of <unk> is 25 percent of the health workers.
When this device <unk> a RNA virus or DNA <unk> call the <unk> and first of all, avoiding the epidemic.
But this is the biggest force of producing a world of abundance.
I call it the <unk>
The white lines here are the population.
We've just got the brand of 7 billion <unk>
By the way, the best protection against population explosion is to provide the world of education and health.
In 2010, we had less than two billion people online, connected with.
By 2020, we'll go from two billion to five billion users of the Internet.
Three billion minds never before <unk> to the global conversation.
What do these people?
What do you do? What do you want?
And instead of a economic collapse we will have the greatest economic injection of history.
These people represent tens of billions of dollars in the global economy.
And most health care thanks to the <unk> of a better education with the Khan Academy and because of the use of printing printing and computer computing will be more productive than ever before.
What can they provide us 3,000 million more members of mankind, healthy and <unk>
How about some voices you have never been <unk>
What if we give them <unk> wherever they are, a voice to be heard and be able to act for the first time?
What are these 3,000 billion?
And if they are contributions we cannot <unk>
One thing I learned with the X X is that the small equipment is that small, guided by their passion with an objective of course, they can do things -- things that could only do things that could only do the big corporations and governments.
I'm going to end up sharing a story that was really excited about.
There's a program that maybe some of you know.
It's called <unk>
<unk> at the University of Washington, in Seattle.
It's a game where people can take a sequence of amino acids and figure out how the protein.
The folds determine the structure and functionality.
It's very important in medical research.
And so far, it was a problem of <unk>
They've played with this university professors, among others.
Then hundreds of thousands of people joined and started <unk>
And it's shown that the recognition of recognition of human patterns is better folding than the best computers.
Ladies and gentlemen, what gives me a huge confidence in the future is that we have more power to take the big challenges on the planet.
We have the tools with this exponential technology.
We have the passion of <unk>
We have the capital of <unk>
And we have three billion new minds that we are focused on to work on the solution of the big challenges and do what we should do.
We have in front of a few decades here.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk about a very <unk> idea.
<unk> the <unk>
And as the idea can be explained in a minute, before you give them three examples to do time.
The first story is about Charles Darwin, one of my heroes.
He was here, as you know, in <unk>
Maybe they believed that <unk> <unk> but it didn't.
They actually <unk> fish.
And he described one of them as very <unk>
It was the <unk>
It caught it much until the <unk>
Now the fish is in the Red Cross <unk>
But we've heard this story a lot of times, about the Galapagos and other places, so that doesn't have anything special.
But the case is that we still come to the Galapagos.
We still think they're <unk>
The <unk> they still say they're still <unk>
So what happens here?
The second story, also illustrates another concept the shift in the waist.
Because I was there in <unk> studying a water in West Africa.
I was there because I grew up in Europe, and then I wanted to work in Africa.
I thought I could <unk>
I burned a lot with the sun and I was convinced that I was not there.
This is my first exhibition to the sun.
The lagoon was surrounded by <unk> and as you can see, from the mangroves.
There were <unk> from about 20 inches, my black beard <unk>
And the fish of this <unk> was very abundant and it was for a good moment, so that was made more than the average in Ghana.
When I went there 27 years later the amount of fish had dropped in half.
I went to five centimeters.
It will be a genetic pressure.
There was still fish.
In a way, they were still happy.
And the fish were still happy to be there.
That's nothing to change, but everything has changed.
My third story is that I was complicit in the introduction of <unk> fisheries, in Southeast Asia.
In the 1970s -- I think it started in <unk> Europe did a lot of developing projects.
<unk> development was going to impose to the countries that already had 100,000 dollars."
And this boat, quite nice and called the <unk> 4.
I went to fish in it, and we did studies in the southern Sea of China <unk> and, above all, in the <unk> Sea.
What we capture there was something <unk>
<unk> now -- the bottom of the sea.
Ninety percent of what we capture was <unk> other animals that are at the bottom.
And most of the fish are blobs of <unk> tiny about each other, remains of a remains of coral reef.
In short, the bottom of the sea came to the deck and then it was <unk>
These images are extraordinary because the transition is very fast.
In a year, you do a study and then start the commercial fisheries.
The bottom line is going to be a solid coral fund in this case, to be a <unk>
This is a dead <unk>
I didn't buy them. The <unk> because they were dead.
We once capture a living.
I was still not <unk>
So they wanted to <unk> it because it was a good food.
This mountain of remains is what the fishermen are collected every time that they have ever fish.
But it was not <unk>
<unk> the world, we don't remember it.
We would take the starting point to the new level, without remembering what was there.
If you look at this something like this.
On the Y-axis, we have <unk> biodiversity, much of <unk> the <unk> of the country, the water supply.
And that changes the time. It changes because people do things with <unk>
Every generation will use images in the beginning of their conscious life as the normal and what you'll extrapolate forward forward.
The difference is they perceive loss.
But they don't perceive the loss that happened before.
You can analyze the string of changes.
And at the end to keep the <unk> remains.
And that, in a large extent, is we want to do now.
We want to keep things that are no longer or not what they were.
But you should think that this problem affects people when societies -- they kill animals without knowing what they've done to some generations later.
Because, obviously, an animal that is very prevalent before <unk> is unusual.
You don't lose animals.
You lose little animals.
Even if this is not perceived as a huge loss.
Over time, we focus on big animals, and in a sea for great fish.
They become <unk> because the <unk>
There are just a few fish, but we think that that's the point of departure.
And the question is, why do we accept this?
Well, because we don't know it was different.
In fact, a lot of people, scientists, <unk> that was very different.
And they'll do it because the evidence presented in an earlier way, is not the way they would expect the evidence.
For example, the anecdote that some <unk> as captain such as captain such as captain such a little bit of fish in this area cannot be used or, generally they don't use the American scientists because it's not <unk>
So we have a situation where people don't know the past, even though we lived in <unk> societies because they don't trust the sources.
There is the huge role that can fulfill a protected marine area.
Because with the protected areas, we really recreated the past.
<unk> the past that people can't conceive because the starting point has been running and it's very low.
That's for people who can see a protected marine area and they can benefit from the vision that they <unk> which allows them to erase their point of origin.
And what about people who can't do it because they don't have access, like the people in the Middle East, for example?
And I think there are the arts and cinema may fill the vacuum. The simulation.
This is a simulation of the Bay Bay.
A long time ago, there were gray whales in the <unk> bay 500 years ago.
And you may have noticed that the <unk> and <unk> are like <unk>
And if you think about <unk> if you think about why people were moved with the movie <unk> to talk about the story of <unk> why do we <unk>
Because it raises something that, in a sense, has been lost.
So my <unk> the only one to give, is Cameron, making <unk> <unk> underwater.
Thank you very much.
Hi. I am Kevin <unk> the <unk> trends -- and I look at YouTube YouTube video.
It's true.
So we're going to see what we're going to see is why videos are doing viral and how important it is.
We all want to be <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> When I was younger -- that seemed a very, very difficult thing.
But today, the website today makes any of us, or our actions, copper <unk> in a part of our world culture.
Anybody can get done on the Internet in a <unk>
You get over 48 hours of video to YouTube for a minute.
And of those, only a small percentage are viral is receiving infinite views and makes cultural <unk>
How does that happen?
Three things: creators of trends, communities of participation.
Okay, <unk>
<unk> <unk> Oh my God, my God.
Oh my God!
Wow.
<unk> <unk>
KA: Last year, <unk> <unk> published this video from his home in the National Park of <unk>
In 2010, it was seen 23 million times.
This graph shows you all the tours in the rise of popularity last summer.
<unk> was not saying to do a viral video.
I just wanted to share a double <unk>
That's what you do if you call <unk> Mountain <unk>
I had already published many videos of nature.
This video had been published in January.
So what happened here?
He was Jimmy <unk>
Jimmy <unk> published this tweet that <unk> the video to the <unk>
The creators of trends like Jimmy <unk> present things new and interesting things and <unk> them to a wider audience.
Rebecca <unk>  It's Friday Friday. You have to start on a Friday.   Everybody wants to come up with the end of a week, the weekend.      <unk> Friday on a Friday.  KA: Don't think that we can have this conversation without talking about this video, I hope.
<unk> of Rebecca is one of the most popular videos of the year.
You saw it nearly 200 million times this year.
This graph shows the frequency of use.
Just like <unk> <unk> this video seemed to have come from nothing.
So what did this day?
Well, it was Friday, it's true.
And if you ask those other <unk> they're also a Friday.
But what happened this day, this Friday <unk>
Well, I took them <unk> and many blogs started writing about it.
Michael <unk> <unk> from <unk> Science -- was one of the first people to make a joke about video on Twitter.
But the important thing is that a person or a group of creators embrace on a view of view, and they share with a larger audience, accelerating the process.
So this community of people who share this large internal joke then starts talking about that and doing things.
And now there's 10,000 dollars of <unk> on YouTube.
Just in the first seven days, there was a parody for each other days.
Unlike the 20th century <unk> of the 20th century, this communal participation is our way to be part of the phenomenon, or doing something new with <unk>
<unk> <unk> is an animation born with a <unk> music.
So that's it. That's it.
This year they saw it about 50 million times.
And if you think that that is rare, you know there's a three hours that has been seen four million times.
All the cats saw this video.
And there are cats that saw other cats see the video.
But the important thing here is creativity that woke up between the Internet <unk> community.
There was <unk>
Somebody did an old version of it.
And then international became international again.
Suddenly, a whole community of <unk> that made this happen from being a silly joke about what we all can do.
Because today not just <unk> <unk>
Who could have predicted something like this?
Who could have predicted <unk> <unk> or RS: Black or <unk> <unk>
What about script might have been written by this situation?
In a world where you get two days of video per minute, just that really unique and unexpected can make it very unique that these things have done.
When a friend told me that I had to see this great video of a guy who protest <unk> to <unk> in New York, I admit that I wasn't interested in too much.
Casey <unk> I was <unk> by the <unk> but often there are obstacles that prevent you properly by the <unk>
KA: Thank you the surprise of the surprise and your humor, Casey <unk> made it five million to see and understand her idea.
So this approach is worth the whole new thing we do in a creative way.
And all of this leads to a great question.
<unk> <unk> What does this mean?
<unk>
KA: What does this mean?
The creators of trend creative communities of participation, fully unexpected, are features of a new media -- that we all have access and is the audience that defines the <unk>
As I said before, one of the current celebrities of the world, Justin <unk> started on YouTube.
We don't want permission to express your ideas.
Now we're all a little owners of our pop culture.
These are not the characteristics of the old media -- they're just the media today, but we have the entertainment entertainment.
Thank you.
This is not a <unk> story.
It's a puzzle that's still <unk>
Let me tell you about some of the pieces.
Imagine the first <unk> a man burning the work of a life.
It's a poet, a man whose entire life had been supported by the only unit and freedom of his country.
<unk> as the <unk> come into <unk> facing the fact that their life had been totally in vain.
So words, for so long -- <unk> now <unk>
It was <unk> in silence.
He died broken by history.
He's my grandfather.
I never met him.
But our lives are much more than our memories.
My grandmother never allowed me to forget his story.
My task was not to let that have been in <unk> and my lesson was to learn that the story tried to <unk> it, but I did it.
The next part of the puzzle is about a boat to the dawn <unk> <unk> towards the sea.
My mother, <unk> was just 18 years old when her father died, and a small girl and two small girls.
For her, life had been due to a <unk> task, the escape from her family and a new life in Australia.
It was <unk> for her that I couldn't do that.
And after a <unk> <unk> that challenges the fiction, a boat slid into the dry sea of ship vessel.
All adults knew the risks.
The biggest fear of fear was the rape and death.
As most adults -- my mother was wearing a <unk> with poison.
If we were telling us first we would take my sister and I, and then she and my grandmother.
My first memories are from that boat, the constant rate of the engine, the constant rate of the motor, the <unk> diving on every single <unk> and the very vast and gap.
I don't remember the hackers who came several times, but they were <unk> with the bravery of men on our boat, or the engine dying and not being able to start by six hours for six hours.
But I do remember the lights of the platform of the oil platform on the coast of Malaysia, and the young man who collapsed and died, and he went down to the journey was too much to it, and the first apple that I thought, given by the men on the platform.
No apple had later the same flavor.
After three months in a refugee camp, <unk> in <unk>
And the next piece of the puzzle is about four women over three generations to form a new life together.
We set up in <unk> a suburb of class, whose population is <unk>
Unlike the middle class, whose existence was <unk> in <unk> there was no sense of the right.
<unk> smells were the rest of the world.
And the <unk> English fragments were traded between people who had one thing in common: they were starting again.
My mother worked on farms, then in a <unk> assembly line, working six days, <unk>
Even so, I found time to study English and get a headline in <unk> <unk> of <unk>
We were poor.
All of the dollars were <unk> and established an extra mentoring in English and mathematics, they wouldn't mind what it was supposed to be, which is usually <unk>
Two base pairs for school, one to hide the holes on the other.
A bus uniform to <unk> because I had to last six years.
And I had <unk> and <unk> on the <unk> <unk> and some <unk> <unk> go back home."
At home, where?
Something in me is <unk>
I was accumulating determination and a voice that said, "I'm going to <unk>
My mother, my sister and I <unk> in the same bed.
My mother was <unk> every night, but we were getting rid of our day and <unk> the movements of our grandmother at the house.
My mother had <unk> every ship.
And my task was to be awake until his nightmares were in order to be able to express them.
She opened up a computer shop and then studied to be <unk> and opened another business.
And the women would come with their stories about men who couldn't make their transition and angry transition and <unk> boys trapped between two worlds.
They were looking for subsidies and <unk>
And they created centers.
I lived in parallel worlds.
In one, I was the classical African student with what I <unk> of myself.
On the other one, I was <unk> in <unk> lives, tragically <unk> for violence, abuse of drugs and insulation.
But they got help through the years.
And for that work, when I was studying my last year of lawyer who elected the young Australian young man.
And I was overwhelmed with a piece of the puzzle to the other, but its edges don't <unk>
As a <unk> resident <unk> was now as <unk> refugee and social activist and invited to talk in sites that I'd never heard -- and in houses whose existence would never have imagined.
I didn't know the <unk>
I didn't know how to use the <unk>
I didn't know how to talk about wine.
I didn't know how to talk about anything.
I wanted to retire to the routines. And to comfort the life in a suburb <unk> -- a grandmother, a mother and two daughters finishing the day as they did for almost 20 years, <unk> over the day of each and <unk> <unk> the three still in the same bed.
And I told my mom that I couldn't do it.
It reminded me that I had now the same age as she had when she got into the ship.
<unk> had never been an option.
He said to me, "What not <unk>
So I talked about <unk> youth and education and <unk> the <unk> and the <unk>
And the more frankly -- the more I was talking about, the more it was <unk>
I met people from all the roads in life, many of them doing what they <unk> living on the border of possible.
And although I ended up my <unk> I realized I couldn't stay in a law race.
There had to be another piece of the puzzle.
And I realized at the same time it's going to be an unknown, a <unk> new at the scene -- and not only it's fine, but it's something that is being grateful, maybe a gift of the ship.
Because being inside it can easily mean <unk> the <unk> can easily mean accept the assumptions of your <unk>
And I gave enough steps out of my comfort zone to know that, yes, the world is <unk> but not the way we fear it.
<unk> that they hadn't been <unk> they were <unk> tremendously.
There was a energy there, a optimism -- a kind of humility and courage.
So I followed my intuition.
<unk> a small group of people for whom the slogan cannot <unk> was a <unk> challenge.
For a year we didn't have a <unk>
At the end of every day, it was a giant pot of soup that all <unk>
<unk> at the night.
Most of our ideas were mad, but some brilliant and we open up.
I took the decision to move to the United States.
And then just trip.
My hunches again.
Three months later, I had <unk> and <unk> adventure.
Before the end, let me tell you about my grandmother.
She grew up at a time when the <unk> was the social norm and the local <unk> was the person who did care.
Life had not changed for centuries.
His father died shortly after she was born.
The mother was raised by it.
At 17 became a <unk> of a <unk> whose mother <unk>
Without their husband, he caused an <unk> to the <unk> and to take the cause itself, and much more <unk> caused when I won.
It cannot happen to be wrong.
I was in the shower in the room of a hotel when she died, <unk> <unk>
I looked through the <unk> of the shower and saw him stop on the other side.
I knew I had come to <unk>
My mother called minutes later.
Days later, later, we went to a Buddhist temple in <unk> and sat around her <unk>
We tell the stories and we made sure we were still with it.
At night, a monk came and told us he had to close the <unk>
My mother asked us to raise his hand.
I asked the <unk> "Why is her hand <unk> and the rest of the body so <unk>
"Because you have taken your hand from the <unk> he said.
"You haven't <unk>
If there's a nerve in our family, that runs through women.
Since those of us and how life we built on us, we can now see that the men who had come to our lives would have been <unk>
The defeat would have very easily.
I want to have my own children, and I wonder about the ship.
Who could wish that to you?
However, I'm afraid of the privilege of the easy, of the right.
I can give you a <unk> in your life, a fearless woman in each <unk> the <unk> rate of the engine, the vast horizon that doesn't guarantee nothing?
I don't know.
But if I could give it and look at it, I would do it.
<unk> <unk> and also the mother of this is now here, in the fourth or fifth row.
My story begins in <unk> about two years ago.
I was in the desert, under the <unk> sky with the singer <unk> <unk> <unk>
We were having a conversation about how nothing has changed since the ancient Indian <unk> <unk>
In those days when the Indians we wanted to travel <unk> to a car and put it in the sky.
Now we do it with airplane.
At that time, when you put the great prince of Prince Indian warrior -- I was <unk> he took a bow and with a <unk> on the ground, she got water.
We now do the same with <unk> and machines.
The conclusion that we launched was that the machinery had replaced the magic.
And that blew my mind.
Every time I felt a little bit more <unk>
I was struck by this idea of losing the ability to enjoy and appreciating a sunset if I didn't have the camera, if I couldn't tell my friends.
It seemed like the technology had to let the magic not kill her.
As a child my grandfather gave me his silver <unk>
And this <unk> technology was for my most magic thing.
It became a golden door to a world full of imagery, and <unk> in my imagination.
I had the feeling that the mobile clocks and the luxury clocks and the cameras prevent that to <unk>
We <unk> our inspiration.
And so I got <unk> I threw this technological world to see how it used to create magic, rather than killing her.
I was books from the age of 16.
So when I saw the iPad I saw a storytelling device able to connect readers of the entire world.
You can know how we took the book.
Where we are.
We bring the text together with the image, the animation, sound and touch.
The storytelling becomes increasingly <unk>
But why does that do that?
I'm about launching <unk> an interactive application for the iPad.
It says, <unk> your fingers on each light."
And so ...  He says, "This box is <unk> I write my name.
And so I go back a character from the book.
And at several times it comes to me a <unk> -- the iPad knows where I live alive because of the GPS -- that's led to me.
My inner girl is excited about all these possibilities.
I've talked a lot of magic.
And I don't mean magicians and <unk> but to that magic of childhood -- to those ideas that <unk> children.
For some reason, fireflies in a jar always turned out to me.
So here, we have to tilt the iPad to release the fireflies.
And indeed, they light your way into what the <unk> of the book.
Another idea that I was fascinated with a little girl was that a whole galaxy, in a <unk>
So here, every book and every single world turns into a <unk> that I move towards this magic device inside the device.
And this opens up a map.
In every fantasy book, there has always been maps but have been static maps.
This is a map that goes up, <unk> and guide you for the rest of the book.
In certain points of the book it was <unk>
Now I'm going to come in.
Another very important aspect of me is to create Indian content.
These are the <unk>
We've all heard of <unk> and <unk> but how many people out of India know their counterparts <unk> the <unk>
These poor <unk> have been trapped in the cameras of Indra for millennia, in an <unk> and <unk> book.
So we're bringing them back into a children's story.
In a story that tries to do current issues like environmental crisis.
And talking about the environmental crisis, one of the problems in the last 10 years has been that children have been <unk> attached to their <unk> they haven't left the outside world.
But now with mobile technology, we can take our children into the natural world with their technology.
One of the interactions of the book is this adventure where you have to go out there, take the camera or the iPad, and collect images of different natural objects.
As a child, I had a lot of <unk> <unk> stones, <unk> and <unk>
For some reason why children don't do it.
So to recover this childhood ritual you have to go out and in a chapter, we would take a picture to a flower and then <unk>
In another chapter, you have to take a picture of a piece of cortex and then <unk>
This is an creates a whole digital collection of photos that then can be put on the Web.
A picture of London puts a picture of a <unk> and says, "Oh, I saw a <unk>
A child in India says, "I saw a <unk>
And you create this kind of social network around a collection of digital photos that have been taking.
Inside the variants of the moon between magic, Earth and technology are many possibilities.
In the next book, we have an interaction where you get out with the iPad and video on, and through augmented reality, it sees a bunch of cartoons of cartoons that appear on the inner plants.
And at a moment the screen is full of leaves.
And you have to make sound of wind and <unk> to be able to read the rest of the book.
We're going to a world where the forces of nature are <unk> with technology and magic and technology get closer to another.
We <unk> the energy of the sun.
We're approaching our children and ourselves to the natural world and that magic, <unk> and child love, that we sit through a simple story.
Thank you.
I'd like to talk to you about why many projects of <unk> <unk>
And I think, really, that the most important thing about that is we stop listening to patients.
And one of the things we did at the University <unk> was <unk> to a CEO of listening.
And not in a very scientific way, she raised a little cup of coffee or tea and asked for patients, family and <unk> What <unk>
"How can we <unk>
And we tend to think that this is one of the biggest problems that we all do, or maybe not all, but most of the <unk> projects are involved, because we stopped listening.
This is my Wi-Fi scale. It's something very simple.
It has a <unk> and flat part.
Every morning I was <unk>
And yes, I have a challenge as you can see.
I got the challenge of getting to 95 percent.
But it's so simple, that every time I <unk> sends my information to Google <unk>
And my doctor of <unk> has access to him as well. And so he can see what my life problem is -- not at the same time that I need it support, or some urgency of that style -- but looking at it backwards.
But there's something else.
Like some of you know, I have more than 4,000 Twitter on Twitter.
So every morning I connect to my Wi-Fi scale, and before you get up to my car, people start to <unk> <unk> today I think you need a light lunch.
That's the best thing that can happen, because it's pressure of the peers used to help patients, because it could be used for obesity, and also for patients stop smoking.
On the other hand, it can lead to people of their chairs and together to develop some activity in order to have more control of their health.
The next week is going to be available from next week.
This little <unk> connected to an iPhone or another device.
And people are going to sit from their houses, take their blood pressure, to their doctor, and share it with each other, for 100 dollars.
This is the point where patients assume a position, come back to the control and to be ship from their own <unk> but it can also help us care about health care because of the challenges that we face, as the firing of costs of attention, the demand for demand and other issues.
We have techniques that are simple to use and start with this to engage patients in the team.
And you can do it with techniques like these, but also through <unk>
And one of the things we did want to share with you with you with a video.
We all have checks in the <unk>
Maybe we even have them on our cell phones.
We know perfectly where <unk> machines are.
Where are all the <unk>
And of course, we can find strings of fast food.
But where is the closest <unk> to help this patient?
We said, but no one would be <unk>
No one knew where to get the <unk> saves lives at this time.
What we did was we do <unk> in the Netherlands.
We created a website, and we asked the public public -- you see a <unk> please look at <unk> where, and when is it open, because they sometimes open up in <unk> <unk> and others are closed.
And over 10,000 <unk> they were introduced in the Netherlands.
The next step was to look for the application for that.
And we did an application for the iPad.
We created an application for <unk> reality to find these <unk>
And every time you're in the city of <unk> and somebody else -- they can use your iPhone, and to the next few weeks to use his cell phone from Microsoft to find the nearest <unk> which can save lives.
And from today, I'd like to introduce this one, not just as <unk> <unk> which is the name of the product, but also as a <unk>
And we want to take a world globally.
We're <unk> all of the colleagues in the world, at other universities, so that we will help us find and work as a center for the <unk> of <unk> around the world.
Every time you're on vacation and someone <unk> can be a relative or somebody in front of you, you can find it.
I also want to invite companies around the world that could help us validate these <unk>
You might be messaging services or people -- for instance, to see if the <unk> shown is still in their place.
Please forgive me on this and not just improve health, but take control of it.
Thank you very much.
I'm here to share <unk> photography.
Or is it <unk> <unk>
Because of course, they're photographs that you can't take with your cameras.
My interest through photography was woke up with my first digital camera at 15 years.
And I mixed with my earlier passion for the drawing -- but it was a little bit different because by using the camera the process was in planning.
And when you take a photograph with a camera the process ends up when the <unk> <unk>
For me, photography had more to do with being in the right place at the right time.
It seemed like anybody could do it.
So I wanted to create something different, a process that would start to press the <unk>
It was like this: A building on a very <unk> road.
But it has an unexpected turn.
And even though it keeps a <unk>
Or pictures like <unk> dark and colorful <unk> but with the common goal to keep the <unk>
And when I say realism I say <unk>
Because of course, it's not something I can do, but I always want it to be captured in some way as photography.
You know, where you will have to think about a moment to discover the trick.
It's more than to do with capture an idea that with capturing a moment.
But what's the trick that makes it look real?
Is it the details or the <unk>
Let's get a light?
What do you create <unk>
Sometimes the illusion is perspective.
But at the end it's about how we interpret the world and how you can perceive on a <unk> surface.
It's not really about whether it's realistic but what we think is a realistic.
So I think the foundations are very simple.
I see it as a puzzle of reality where we took different pieces of reality, and we put them together to create an alternative reality.
I'll show you a simple example.
Here we have three perfectly <unk> objects that we can all relate to the three-dimensional world.
But it combined in a certain way can create something that still looks like <unk> as if they existed.
But at the same time, we know it doesn't exist.
So let's bring the brain because the brain doesn't embrace the fact that it really makes no sense.
And I see the same process when you combine the photographs.
It's really <unk> <unk>
And the things that make a picture look like realistic as realistic as a realistic picture, I think that's those in which we don't even understand the things around us in our everyday lives.
But when you combine pictures it's very important to <unk> because otherwise something is going to be wrong.
So I would like to say that there are three simple rules going on to make realistic results.
As you can see, these images are not very special.
But <unk> can create something like this.
So the first rule is that the combination of pictures must have the same perspective.
Second, the photos are <unk> they must have the same kind of light.
And these two images meet these <unk> they were taken to the same height and with the same kind of light.
The third point is to make us impossible to distinguish the beginning, and the end of the different images with a perfect fight.
It has to be impossible to see where the image.
This is another example.
You might think that this is the image of a landscape and the bottom part is <unk>
But this picture is totally comprised of photographs of different places.
And in the staff I think it's easier to create a place that will find it because you don't need to have the danger of ideas that have on your head.
But it takes a lot of planning.
And as I thought about this idea in winter I knew I had several months to find them to find the different locations for the pieces of the puzzle.
For example, the fish was captured on a fishing trip.
The shores of a different location.
The <unk> part was captured in a stick of rock.
And yes, I even made red the house on the top of the island to look more <unk>
So to get a realistic result, I think we need planning.
You can always start with a <unk> an idea.
Then you need to combine the different pictures.
And here every piece is very <unk>
If you do a good job when you take the pictures the result can be very beautiful, and at the time very <unk>
All the tools are there and the only limit is our imagination.
Thank you.
I'll start showing you a slide on technology, very boring.
Please if you can <unk>
It's a diagram anybody I took out of a folder of mine.
I'm not really interested in showing you the details but the general side.
This is an analysis that we were doing on the power of Tasmania. microprocessors versus power of local area.
What's interesting about this is that this one, as a lot of other people that we tend to see, is a kind of a straight line on scale.
In other words, every step of here represents an order of magnitude on the performance scale.
I'm going to talk about technology with <unk> curves.
This is a strange thing.
And that's what I'm going to talk about.
Please turn the lights.
It gets more intensity because writing about paper.
Why are we <unk> curves in technological scales.
The answer is that if I draw them in a normal curve, which is, say, these are the years or some of the time, and this would be any measure of the technology that I want to give you the diagram would look something ridiculous.
It would be something like this.
It doesn't tell a lot.
But if you will, for example, some other technology, like transportation, in a <unk> <unk> would be very dumb, you'd see a straight line.
But if something like this, it gives you a <unk> change.
If the technology of transportation would be as fast as we could take a cab and be in Tokyo in 30 seconds.
But it doesn't go through that rhythm.
There is no <unk> in the history of technological development of <unk> growth that every few years advance of magnitude.
The question I want to ask is -- looking at these <unk> curves we see that they don't keep forever.
It's not possible to hold this change as fast as it goes.
So let's get one of two things.
Or it will be a typical curve, I know like this until it comes to something completely different, or maybe I'll do something like this.
That's all that can happen.
I am optimistic, so I think maybe something like this.
So now we would be in the middle of a transition.
In this line, we're in a transition from what the world used to be the world, in a new way.
So what I'm trying to ask, and to ask myself, is: What is that new way that the world has <unk>
Why new state is the world?
The transition seems very, very confusing if we are engaged in it.
I remember the future was happening in the year 2000 and people used to talk about what would happen in the year 2000.
This is a conference where people talk about the future, and we see that the future is still the year 2000.
That's all we see.
In other words, the future has been spent year after year, along my life.
But I think it's because we feel like something is going on.
That happens a transformation. We can feel it.
And we know that it doesn't really have a lot of sense to think about 30 or 50 years because everything is so different that you extrapolate what we're doing today doesn't make any sense.
So I want to talk to you about how it might be, how it could be that transition to <unk>
But to do that will have to talk a little bit about things that don't have a lot to do with technology and computer and computational technology.
Because I think the only way to understand it is taking distance and looking at things in the long term.
The scale of time where I'd like to do this is the time of life on Earth.
I think this picture makes sense if we look at each one billion years.
So we go back about a half a half a half a half a half and a half half and a lot of chemicals that are <unk> around them.
If we look at the way that those chemicals organized it, we give us an idea of how things happened.
And I think there are theories to start understanding the origin with RNA. I'm going to tell you a simple version of this and that is that, at that time, I had floating out of oil <unk> with all kinds of chemical recipes in their inside.
Some of those oil drops had a particular combination of chemicals that made them put off the outside of the outside of the outside and the <unk> grew to them.
And they began to divide.
In a sense, those were <unk> cell forms those <unk> of oil.
But those drops weren't alive in the current sense, because each one of them contained a random recipe of chemicals.
And every time you <unk> <unk> a distribution of chemicals that we <unk>
So every droplet was a little bit different.
In fact, <unk> that somehow <unk> being better at the time to incorporate chemical chemists -- more chemicals -- and they get more.
Mostly, they lived longer, they were more <unk>
It was a form of life, life chemistry, very simple chemistry, but things become interesting when these drops learned the trick of the <unk>
And somehow we don't understand these <unk> they learned to store information.
They learned to save information, which was the recipe for a cell -- in a special chemical called DNA.
In other words, <unk> in this particular evolution, a system of writing that allowed them to record what they were so <unk>
The amazing thing is that that writing system seems to have remained stable since it evolved two and a half billion years ago.
Our recipe, our genes, you have exactly the same code, that same writing system.
In fact, every living being is expressed with exactly the same set of letters and the same code.
And one of the things I did just by <unk> We can write things with this code.
Here I have 100 <unk> of white dust that I try to hide people at the airport <unk>
But I <unk> I took this <unk> the code has the common letters that we tend to use on this -- and I wrote my personal data in this piece of DNA and it took it 10 to the 22 times.
So if someone wants 100 million copies of my personal card -- I have a lot of all the <unk> in fact, for every person in the world and it's here.
If it was a <unk> he would have put it in a virus and would have been shot in the room.
What was the next <unk>
Writing DNA was an interesting step.
This made these cells be happy about a billion years old.
But then another big step of interesting step in which things were <unk> very different -- and it was that these cells started to exchange and communicate information to forming the cells.
I don't know if you know, but bacteria can exchange DNA.
In that way, for example, antibiotic resistance.
Some bacteria found the way to avoid penicillin and <unk> them to create their small DNA with other bacteria and now there's a lot resistant to penicillin because bacteria communicate.
This communication led to the communities that, in a way, they were together in that -- and established a <unk>
So it would be <unk> or <unk> together, or whether a community was very successful all the individuals in that community to become more and <unk> by evolution.
And the tipping point occurred when these communities came up with so much that, in fact, they came together and decided to write the whole recipe from the community to a chain of DNA.
The next interesting stage for life took another billion years.
And at that stage of stage we have communities -- communities of many kinds of different cell types working together as a single organism.
In fact, we are a <unk> community.
We have a lot of cells that don't run alone.
The skin cell doesn't do without the heart, or the muscles of the muscles or the brain, and so on.
So these communities evolved and produced more interesting levels than cell phone, something we call a organism.
The next level came inside these communities.
These started <unk> information.
And to build very special structures that didn't make more of the information in community.
They're <unk> structures.
The neurons are the appliances that process the <unk> information that those stem cell communities.
In fact, they started <unk> within the community being the responsible structures of <unk> to understand and to convey the information.
Those were the brains and the nervous system of those communities.
And that gave them an evolutionary advantage.
Because at that time as <unk> learning was confined to the duration of an organism, and not the time period of evolutionary time.
So a organism could, for example, learn not to eat a certain round of fruit, because I knew it and sick the last time she ate it.
That could happen during the life of an organism given that they had built these information processing structures that for evolution would have learned for hundreds of thousands of years by the death of individuals who ate that fruit of the fruit.
So the fact that the nervous system built those information from all of us to build up the evolutionary process.
Because evolution could now be confined to an individual.
It could happen in time to learn.
But then, of course, individuals found the trick of communication.
So for example, the most <unk> version we know is human language.
If we think about it, it's an incredible invention.
I have a very complicated idea a really complicated idea in your head.
I'm here sitting here emitting <unk> and hopefully building a similar idea, <unk> and <unk> in your heads that holds some analogy with mine.
But we take something very complicated that we become sound, in sound, and we produce something very complicated in another brain.
That allows us to start to work as a organism.
In fact, as humanity, we've started doing abstractions.
We now spend for periods of similar periods to <unk> organisms -- our <unk> methods.
For example, the invention of language was a small step in that direction.
The <unk> the computer tape -- the video tape and so on, are the specialized mechanisms that we now build to handle that information.
And that brings us into something much larger, faster and able to evolve more than we did before.
Now evolution can happen in microseconds.
You saw the evolutionary <unk> of <unk> in which a certain evolution of evolution made a certain evolution with the program in front of our eyes.
And now we've accelerated the scales of time again.
The first stages of history that I told you took a billion years each.
The next stages, the nervous system and the brain, took a few hundred million years.
<unk> etc., they took less than a million years.
And the next one, like electronics, seems to take just a few decades.
The process is <unk> I guess <unk> is the right word to name something that accelerated its own pace of change.
The more it changes, the faster it does.
And I think that's what we looked at in this explosion of the curve.
We see the process <unk>
But I make my life designing computers and I know that the mechanisms that work for <unk> would not be possible without the recent computer advances.
But now design objects of such a complexity that would be impossible for me to face it differently.
I don't know that every transistor has that machine of connections.
There are thousands of millions.
Instead of that, with the designers of <unk> <unk> we think about a level of abstraction, and we put it into the machine and the machine with that something that you did not could, you get far further and faster than ever before.
In fact, sometimes we use methods that we don't even understand well.
A particularly interesting method that I've been using <unk> is evolution itself.
We put in the machine an evolutionary process that operates on the scale of microseconds.
And for example, in the most extreme cases, we can evolve a program from a random sequence of instructions.
We say, "Please have a computer, you can run a hundred million instructions to chance?
You could run these sequences of instructions at random to run all those programs, and take the ones that we want to do?"
In other words, I define what I want.
Let's say I want to order a simple example to put a simple example.
So we find the programs that are closer to order to numbers.
Of course, it's unlikely to be some random random sequences.
But one, luckily, he could find two numbers in the right order.
And I said, <unk> you could take 10 percent of those random sequences that <unk> the <unk>
Let's get those and put them into the rest.
And now let's get the ones that are best <unk>
And let's go back to <unk> following a process of <unk> analogous to <unk>
Let's take two programs, that <unk> children, that <unk> <unk> and that the children will <unk> the properties of both programs.
So we got a new generation of <unk> programs that had a little more successful.
And we say, "Please repeat the <unk>
<unk> again.
And we had a few mutations here.
And it tries to be new and <unk> with another generation.
Well, every generation takes a few milliseconds.
So I can do the equivalent of millions of years of evolution in a few minutes or in complicated cases, in a few hours.
In the end, we ended up with programs that are going to be an absolutely perfect way.
In fact, they are much more efficient programs than I could have written by hand.
If I look at those programs I can't tell you how they work.
I've tried to test them to see how they work.
They are <unk>
But they get the <unk>
In fact, I know that, I have the safety of the goal because they come from a lineage of hundreds of thousands of shows that they did it.
In fact, their lives are dependent on it.
Once I was going on a 747 with <unk> <unk> and pulled out a card and he says, "Look at this.
He says, airplane has hundreds of thousands of <unk> who work together to offer a <unk> <unk> You don't feel <unk>
We know that engineering processes don't work very well when they become complicated.
So we started to rely on computers to make very different design processes.
And that allows us to produce much more complex things than that makes normal engineering.
But we don't understand all the choices that there are.
In that sense, it goes in front of us.
Now we use those programs to make computers much faster and so can run these programs much faster.
I mean, they <unk>
It's getting faster and faster and so I think it seems so <unk>
Because all of these technologies are <unk>
We are <unk>
And we are at an analog moment of <unk> organisms when they become <unk>
We are the <unk> and we can't understand what the hell we're creating.
We're at the tipping point.
But I think something comes behind us.
I think it would be very arrogant in our part of thinking that we are the final product of evolution.
And I think all of us are part of the creation of whatever it is.
But now comes the lunch and I think stop here before I get stuck.
I think we have to do something with a part of medical culture that has to change.
And I think this starts with a doctor, and that's me.
And I've spent enough time to let me give up part of my fake <unk>
Before I treat the theme of my talk, let's talk a little bit about baseball.
Why not?
We're close in the end, it comes to the World <unk>
We love baseball, right?
The baseball is filled with amazing statistics.
There are hundreds of statistics.
It's going to be out of <unk> <unk> talks about statistics and use them to form a big baseball team.
I'm going to focus on one of them and hopefully a lot of you know.
It's called average <unk>
And we talked about 300 percent of a <unk> that <unk> 300.
That means the bat <unk> <unk> three of 10 times.
That means throwing the ball into the game of game without being <unk> and that anyone who is <unk> to the first base -- not to come to time, and the second base will be <unk>
Three <unk>
You know how they call a <unk> of 300 in Big <unk>
Well, really well, maybe the team of stars.
You know how they call a baseball <unk>
By the way, that's somebody from 10 <unk>
<unk> like the legendary Ted Williams, the last player of the League <unk> of <unk> in running more 400 strokes on a regular season.
Now let's get this to my world of medicine where I feel much more <unk> or maybe less awkward, after what you tell you today.
Suppose you have <unk> and they have a surgeon who has also a record of 400 in <unk>
That's not working, right?
Now suppose they live in a remote place and a dear self has two coronary <unk> <unk> and your family doctor derived from a cardiologist whose record is 200 <unk>
But you know what?
She's getting better this year.
And their hits have been <unk>
This is not working.
But I will ask them.
What do you think is the average of the hits of a heart surgeon or <unk> of a nurse or a <unk> <unk>
There's very well.
And the truth of the issue is that no one in medicine knows the hits of a good surgeon, of a doctor or a <unk>
What we do, though, is to send them to the world, and I included, with the mandate of being perfect.
I would never, ever make a mistake and try to figure out how to do it well.
That was the message that <unk> when I was in medical school.
I was a <unk> student <unk>
Once, a fellow in high school said that Brian Goldman <unk> to a blood <unk>
Such which.
<unk> in my little <unk> in the TED residence at the General Hospital in Toronto, not far from here.
And I learned all of the memory.
From my class of anatomy, <unk> the origin and <unk> <unk> the <unk> of every artery that comes out of the <unk> the differential diagnostic diagnosis and the standard.
And I even knew the <unk> diagnosis about how to classify the <unk> <unk> <unk>
And as long as we got more and more knowledge.
And I was very excited, I graduated from <unk>
And <unk> from medical school with the impression that if you get everything, then you would know everything, or the most possible, close to everything, because I get rid of the mistakes.
And it worked for a while, until I met the lady <unk>
I was a resident in a university hospital here, in Toronto when they brought to the lady <unk> the emergency room where I were working.
At the time, I was assigned to <unk>
And when I requested requested to a cardiologist I had to go to the patient there.
And reporting to the head of residents.
When I saw the lady <unk> I was <unk>
I heard a <unk> sound.
And when the <unk> I heard a <unk> sound on both sides, which gives me a heart failure.
In these conditions, the heart stops working and, instead of <unk> your blood forward, the blood goes to the lungs, these are <unk> and so there's difficulty breathing.
And it wasn't hard to <unk>
I did it and I started working on the treatment that I would give up.
I gave him <unk> and medication to alleviate the pressure on your heart.
I gave him <unk> drink of water, so that I could get it out of liquid.
And in one hour or two, she started feeling better.
And I felt very good.
And that's when I made the first <unk> he sent her home.
I actually made two more mistakes.
He sent her home without talking to the chief of residents.
I didn't wake up the phone and I did what I should have done, that I was calling my boss and <unk> with him for the <unk>
And if my boss had seen it, he would have been able to add <unk> information.
Maybe I did it for a good reason.
Maybe I didn't want to be a resident to pay attention to it.
Maybe I wanted to be so successful and capable of assuming that I could take care of my patients without even talking to my boss.
The second mistake I made I made was worse.
When I send her home, not paid attention to a voice in my inner saying, <unk> isn't a good idea. Don't do it."
In fact, I was so insecure that I asked the nurse who was taking care of the <unk> <unk> who is okay if he goes to her <unk>
And the nurse thought and then said with total <unk> "Yes, I think I'm right."
I remember that as if it was yesterday.
So he signed up the high and the ambulance next to the ambulance and brought her home.
And I went back to the hospital.
The rest of that day, I had a bad <unk> in the stomach.
But I kept on my job.
At the end of the day, I got to leave the hospital and I walked into the parking lot where my car was my car to go home. At that moment I did something I don't normally do normally,
I went through the emergency emergency service of the home.
And there is another nurse, not that I was taking care of the lady before, but another, he said to me three words, those three words that most emergency doctors would have been born.
Other specialists fear fear too, but there's a <unk> in <unk> and is that we see patients <unk>
The three words are: you remember you?
"He remembers the patient he sent to his <unk>
I asked the other nurse with total <unk>
And they said, "Well, she <unk> with the same tone of voice.
She was okay.
But I went back and on the edge of death.
And after an hour of having come to her house, after I gave him the high school, he was a collapse and her family called the <unk> the ambulance brought the emergency room with a <unk> blood pressure of <unk> which means a shock of severe communication.
Just breathe and it was blue.
The emergency personnel <unk> all their resources.
They gave him medication to raise blood pressure.
And they put a <unk>
I was <unk> and <unk> to the core.
He had a mixture of feelings because then the <unk> was in intensive care, and I was hoping for all the hope that they were <unk>
And in the two or three days it was clear that I never would have been.
It had a permanent <unk>
The family got together.
And in eight or nine days, they were going to get into what was happening.
And the ninth day, he left her to go, <unk> lady and grandmother.
They say they never forget the names of those who die.
That was my first experience.
The next few weeks later, I was struck by it and experienced for the first time <unk> shame that exists in our medical culture, and I felt lonely, without feeling that healthy shame because you can't deal with your colleagues.
You make peace and never more makes that mistake.
Is that shame that leaves a teaching.
<unk> shame that I talk about is the one that makes us feel very bad about it.
It's the one that tells us that what we did was wrong, but we're bad guys.
And that felt that.
And it wasn't for my <unk> he was a <unk>
I talked to the family, and I'm sure you were doing the things and made sure that I didn't care about.
And I kept asking those questions.
Why did I not ask my <unk> Why did he send her home?
And my worst <unk> Why did I made a mistake so <unk>
Why did I choose <unk>
Little to the feeling was <unk>
And I started to feel better.
And on one day <unk> the sky opened up and finally came out the sun. And I wondered if I would feel better again.
And I did a deal with myself in which if I was able to save the efforts to be perfect for not to make more mistakes, he would stop at those voices.
And it did.
I went back to work.
But it became going to happen.
Two years later, I was an <unk> in the emergency department in a community hospital north of Toronto, and I got a <unk> man with a pain in your throat.
I was very busy and <unk>
And he pointed out here.
I looked at her throat, I was a little bit <unk>
He was <unk> penicillin and sent him home.
But as he ran to the door kept pointing his throat.
Two days later, when I came to make my guard, my boss asked me to talk to me <unk> in his office.
And he made the three words: <unk> you?
Remember the patient who saw by a pain in <unk>
He came back and I didn't have a <unk> <unk>
It had a potentially deadly condition called <unk>
You can take it on Google -- it's an infection, it's not the throat, but it's the top, and that can cause the close of those tracks.
He fortunately, it wasn't <unk>
And antibiotics is <unk> antibiotics -- and you recovered <unk>
And I went through the same period of shame and <unk> and then I went back to work, until it happened over and over again, and over again.
Two times at the same turn of the <unk> not <unk> <unk>
And it's a big effort, especially to work in a hospital, because they went to 14 patients at the same time.
But in both cases, I didn't send them home and I don't think it's been a <unk>
One of them thought I had a <unk> calculation of it.
He got an X-ray of kidneys but it turned out, a colleague who was checking the patient checking some sensitivity in the lower right quadrant, and he called the surgeon.
The other patient was a lot of diarrhea.
He was liquid order to <unk> and I asked my colleague to <unk>
I reviewed it and when you noticed some sensitivity in the bottom right quadrant, called the surgeon.
Both of them were operated and recovered well.
But every single case I was obsessed with me.
But I'd like to tell you that I made the worst mistakes in the first five years of exercise, and as many colleagues say, is a <unk>
The most meaningful ones have been for the last five years.
<unk> embarrassed and not support.
And here's the problem: If I can't tell you and talk about my mistakes, if I can't find the <unk> that tells me what really happens, how can I share this with my <unk>
How do I show this to not make the same <unk>
If I could go to a place like this, I wouldn't have an idea of what you think about me.
When did you have the last time you heard somebody talking about failure, after I'm trying to failure?
Of course at a party you'll hear about the mistakes of other doctors, but you'll not hear someone talking about their own mistakes.
And if I knew and my colleagues as well, who was a <unk> in my hospital <unk> the wrong leg -- me, it would have a hard time to look at the eyes.
This is the system we have.
<unk> denial of mistakes.
It's the system where there are two <unk> which make mistakes and the ones that don't have to sleep and the ones that I believe, the results are <unk> and the ones that have great outcomes.
And it's almost like a <unk> reaction as we start to attack that person.
We have the idea that if you ask for medicine to people who make mistakes, we will become a safe system.
But that brings two problems.
In 20 years of diffusion and medical journalism, I have made a personal study of bad medical litigation and mistakes doctors to learn how we can, from the first article I wrote for the Toronto Trek -- to my <unk> <unk> Black <unk> Black <unk> white, <unk> art.
And what I learned is that mistakes are <unk>
We work in a system where mistakes happens every single day, where one in every 10 drugs are going to be <unk> in the hospital are wrong, or <unk> is not right. In a system where hospital-acquired infections, are increasingly <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and death.
In this country, 24,000 Canadian mistakes were <unk>
The U.S. Institute established 100,000.
In both cases, it's about <unk> <unk> because we're not <unk> the problem as we should.
And that's what things are.
A <unk> system where knowledge is multiply every two or three years, and we don't care about it.
I was full of sleep deprivation.
And we can't get rid of it.
We have cognitive biases that allow a perfect history of a patient with pain in the chest.
Now, let's take the same patient with a chest pain -- it comes <unk> with <unk> eyes, and with breath to alcohol and suddenly my story <unk> of contempt.
It's not the same story.
I'm not a <unk> I don't do things as well.
And my patients are not cars. They didn't have their symptoms always the same way.
All of this, mistakes are inevitable.
So if we take the system as we got together, and we eliminate all the bad professionals to error, well, you don't have no one.
And with respect to people who don't want to talk about their more <unk>
In my <unk> <unk> white art, <unk> <unk> is my worst <unk> I would tell everybody, from the <unk> to the chief of <unk> <unk> "This is my worst <unk> blah blah blah blah blah blah blah -- "What are your <unk> And you get the microphone towards them.
And their students were <unk> <unk> <unk> head and <unk> saliva and started telling their stories.
They want to tell their stories, they want to share them.
They were able to say, "Look, don't make the same <unk>
They need a context where they can do it.
They need a medical medical culture.
And it starts with a doctor every time.
The <unk> doctor is human, they know how to accept it, and it won't be proud of their mistakes, but it's trying to learn from what happened to teach others.
They have their experiences with them.
It's support for those who talk about their mistakes.
<unk> other people's mistakes not with the intention of <unk> but in a loving way and support for everyone to <unk>
And it works in a medical culture that recognizes that human beings run the system, and when this happens, they make mistakes once in time.
My name is Brian <unk>
I'm a <unk> doctor.
I am a human, we will make mistakes.
And I feel so much about learning something that can convey to others.
I don't know what you think about me, but I can live with that.
And let me conclude with three words -- I remember it.
Do you know how many decisions we take one day.
Do you know how much we choose in a week?
I recently made a survey to more than 2,000 people and the average amount of choices that he says to pick an average American is about 70 a day.
Not a long ago in research for a week to a group of presidents of companies.
The researchers recorded all the different tasks <unk> these executives and the time that we would try to make decisions related to those tasks.
They found that, on average, <unk> <unk> work a week.
Naturally, every job included a lot of <unk>
Half of those decisions took nine minutes or less.
Only 12 percent required only one hour or more of your time.
Now think of your choices.
Do you know how many you belong to the <unk> category and how many of the <unk>
How do we play the way that they deal with those <unk>
Today I want to talk about one of the biggest problems of <unk> choosing to the overload of choices.
I want to talk about the problem and some possible solutions.
As I talk about this I'm going to ask you a few questions, and I need to know your answers.
When I make a question, like I'm blind, raise your hand just if you want to burn calories.
Otherwise when you ask a question, if your answer is positive please give you a <unk>
And now my first question on the day, you're ready to hear about the <unk> problem.
Thank you.
Being a graduate student at the University of Stanford, <unk> this very, very <unk> supermarket. at least at the time was very sophisticated.
It was called <unk>
It was almost like going to an amusement park.
There were like 250 different kinds of mustard and <unk> over 500 different types of fruits and vegetables and about 25 percent water -- and this was when we were taking water from the tap.
I loved going to that store, but on one occasion, I asked myself, why never I buy anything?
This is the shelf oil <unk>
They had more than 75 different classes, including the ones that were in <unk> box that came from <unk> trees.
I once went to visit the manager and I asked him, <unk> well this strategy of offering all these <unk>
He pointed out to me the buses full of tourists which came up every day, usually with her cameras.
We decided to do a little experiment with <unk> This is the <unk>
hall.
They had a different classes.
It was a post for <unk> right to the shop.
We put it out of six <unk> or 24 flavors and we looked at two things: First of all, where people were willing to stop trying to test the <unk>
More people stopped when I had <unk> a <unk> that when there was only six, 40 percent.
We also looked at what case they were more likely to buy a jar of <unk>
So here's the opposite effect.
Of those who stopped when there was 24, only three percent got to buy <unk>
When he had six, I saw 30 percent bought <unk>
If we do the calculations, people had six times more likely to buy <unk> if they were six.
Well, to decide that we don't buy -- we probably <unk> -- it's probably good for conserving <unk> but it turns out that the overload problem affects us in good decisions.
We decided not to decide, even though this doesn't bother us.
Now the issue of the day, the financial savings.
I'm going to describe a study that I did with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> where we see decisions about savings for about a million Americans, from about 650 plans to this country.
We were interested in seeing whether the number of funds available in savings plans for retirement, the <unk> program will bring people to save for the future.
And we found that there was really a <unk>
We had <unk> plans that went from two, to 59 different options.
We found that the bigger the number of funds, there were less participation.
So if we look at the ends, we see that in the plans that offer two funds, the rate of participation was 70 or more, not as high as I wanted to.
And in the plans.
It turns out that even if you decide to participate, when there is more choices, even in that case, there are negative consequences.
So for those who decided to participate, the more the number of choices, more people will become <unk> by avoiding actions or investment funds.
As soon as they had more choices, they were more willing to invest in market financial accounts.
But none of these extreme decisions are the ones that we have <unk> to optimize the future financial well-being.
In the previous decade we've seen three of the main negative consequences to offer more and more possibilities.
The most likely is that <unk> the decision, even when it goes against their own interest.
Are you more likely to take the worst <unk> in finance and health.
They are more likely to pick things less <unk> even though you see them better.
The main reason is that we have <unk> to look at that gigantic variety of <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> but we are not able to do the calculations for <unk> contrast and choose that awesome <unk>
Today I want to propose to you about four simple techniques that we've <unk> in one form or another, in different research, so you can test it in your business.
The first one is, <unk>
You have heard before, but it has never been more true than today, than less is more.
People are always upset when I say, <unk>
They care about losing space in <unk>
But what we're seeing is what we're seeing more and more is that if you decide to cut, you get strange <unk> you will get a <unk> increase in sales, the costs, there will be a better experience in the choice.
When <unk> & <unk> went from 26 types of <unk> & <unk> to 15, saw 10 percent increase in sales.
When the corporation -- <unk> <unk> eliminated the products for <unk> of cats that less <unk> was increased by <unk> by two <unk> higher sales and costs.
You know that today's <unk> <unk> they offer 45,000 products.
In a grocery store, you offer about 100,000 products.
But the largest store in the world is <unk> and it offers only 1,400 <unk> a kind of tomato sauce.
In the world of financial savings, I think one of the best examples that have emerged on how to manage the choices is by David <unk> by David <unk> the Harvard.
All Harvard employees are automatically <unk> to a insurance fund of life.
People who are really willing to choose, they give them 20 funds, not 300 or more.
You know, often people say, "I don't know how to <unk>
All of them are <unk>
The first thing I do is ask the <unk> <unk> the differences between those options.
And if their employees can't afford them, they won't be able to do their <unk>
This afternoon, before this session, I was talking to <unk>
He told me that I would be willing to offer people from this audience a holiday on the world's most beautiful road in the world.
Here, a <unk>
I want you to read it.
I'm going to give you a few seconds to <unk> and then I want you to give you a applause if you're ready to take the supply of <unk>
<unk> OK. Anyone who's ready to accept your deal.
They're not more?
Well, I'm going to show you something else.
You knew there was a trick.
Who's ready for that <unk>
I think I was really going to hear more hands.
All right.
And actually, you had more information on the first turn, which in the second day, but I can <unk> it and say that the second time was more real.
Because the images made it more real.
This brings me to the second technique to handle the <unk> problem which is <unk>
For people to understand the differences between choices, they have to understand the consequences of every option, and the consequences must feel very much <unk> very concrete,
Why is people spending 15 percent more on average, when you use credit card or credit card than when it uses yet yet.
Because it doesn't seem real money.
It turns out to make it look more real, it can be a very positive tool for people to get more.
We did a study with <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> on <unk> <unk> <unk> who worked in <unk> these people were in a meeting where they were <unk> to a <unk> plan.
And in that meeting, that <unk> exactly as <unk> did a little bit of <unk>
What we added was that we appeal to the staff who would think of the positive things they would think of in their lives if they were saving more money.
With this <unk> there was an increase in <unk> of 20 percent and an increase in the number that they were interested in saving or what they wanted to put on their bank accounts.
The third technique is <unk>
We can handle more categories.
For example, this is a study we did in a conference hall in magazines.
We saw that in the supermarkets <unk> throughout the corridor of the magazines of magazines can contain from <unk> different types to <unk>
But you know?
Because the classification tells me how we can <unk>
These are two jewelry.
One is called <unk> and the other, <unk>
If you think the one on the left is <unk> and on the right is <unk> will give you a <unk>
<unk> Okay.
If you think the one on the left is <unk> and on the right is <unk> will give you a <unk>
Well, something else.
It turns out it's right.
The one on the left is <unk> and on the right is <unk> but you know what?
This framework is completely useless.
<unk> must indicate something to be <unk> not when they <unk>
You often see this problem with those huge lists of fundraising.
I'm supposed to say who they're <unk>
My fourth <unk> <unk> complexity.
It turns out we can manage a lot more information than we think about it, if just a little bit.
We need to increase incremental complexity.
I'm going to show you an example of what I mean.
Let's see a good decision that you buy a car.
This is a German manufacturer of cars that allows <unk> completely.
You have to take 60 decisions.
And these choices vary in the number of choices that they offer each one.
<unk> outside of the car. I have 56 possibilities.
<unk> box <unk> <unk>
What I'm going to do is change the order where the decision happens.
So half of the clients are going to go from lots of options, 56 colors, for about four boxes, four boxes.
The other half of the customers are going to go from a few options, four cents to 56 colors, many options.
And what am I going to do?"
How involved you are.
If you go through the default button in every decision, this indicates that they're <unk> or <unk> we're <unk>
We found that the ones that go from many options at the time -- they would take the default button over and over again, and more.
I <unk>
If you go from a few choices to many, they continue there.
Same information, the same number of choices.
The only thing I did was to disrupt the order where information is presented.
If we start with how easy, you learn to <unk>
Even though we choose the box of changes doesn't say nothing about the preferences of interior decoration.
We get excited about a product that we're building now has more engaged in the process.
In order to sum up.
I've talked about four techniques to mitigate the problem of the overload of a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> alternatives to do that, we can manage more categories of fewer <unk> <unk> <unk>
All of these techniques I've been presented with were designed to help manage the <unk> or better, for you, to use them in their own business, or to people who work.
It is that I think the key to getting the best of a choice is being careful by <unk>
And the more careful we are in our best choices we can practice the art of choice.
Thank you very much.
In the 1960s. In East Germany <unk> if you had a writing machine I should be <unk> to the government.
I had to register a piece of text text written with the machine.
And this for the government to track the origin of the texts.
If they found a written written with the wrong message, you could track the footprint to the origin of the idea.
In the West we don't think that somebody could do this, so much that this is the freedom of expression.
We would never do that in our countries.
But today, in 2011, if you buy a laser printer from any big manufacturer of any big manufacturer and print a page, that page will end up having a few yellow print on every page that you follow a pattern that makes you own one and your printer.
That's happening today.
And nobody seems to be a lot like this.
This is an example of the ways our governments use technology against us, the citizens.
And it's one of the three main causes of problems on the network.
If you look at what's happening in the online world, we can put the attacks on their <unk>
There are three main groups.
Are the <unk>
Like Mr. <unk> <unk> of <unk> city in Ukraine.
Your mobile phone is very easy to understand.
These guys make money.
They use <unk> to earn a lot of money, a huge amount of money.
There are really many cases of <unk> online, which is <unk> money with their attacks.
This is <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk>
This is Alfred <unk>
This is Stephen <unk>
This is <unk> <unk>
These are Matthew Anderson, <unk> etc., etc., etc.
These guys make their fortunes online, but they do it by illegal media through <unk> banking to steal money from our accounts when we buy in <unk> or steal our keys to get information from our cards when we buy in a <unk> computer.
The secret secret in the United States, two months ago, <unk> the Swiss account.
Mr. <unk> is <unk> they don't know her <unk>
And I say today is more likely to be a victim of a <unk> than a real crime.
And it's very obvious that this is going to be wrong with worse.
In the future, most of the crime <unk>
The second group of bombers that we see today is not driven by money.
There's another thing that moves, they motivate them the protests, they motivate us the opinions, they motivate you to laughter.
Groups like Anonymous have <unk> over the last 12 months, occupying a prominent role in the online attacks.
Those are the three main bombers <unk> the criminals that do for money, the <unk> as Anonymous that they do for protest and the last group is the national governments that are <unk>
And then we see cases like <unk>
That's a good example of government attack against its own citizens.
<unk> is a <unk> authority of the Netherlands -- or actually it was.
<unk> the collapse last fall because of a <unk>
It would take the safety of the site and lead a <unk>
Last week, I asked a meeting with representatives of the Dutch government, asked one of the leaders if you were born, and they asked the death of people to cause their heart to <unk>
And the answer of it was yes.
So how do people die.
<unk> is a <unk> authority.
<unk> <unk>
Why do you serve it?
Well, you need if you have a website with <unk> <unk> services like <unk>
Except that we <unk> a foreign <unk>
And they were going to protect <unk> <unk>
And in the case of <unk> it happened exactly that.
And what happened in the Arab Spring and those things that have happened, for example, in <unk>
Well, in Egypt in Egypt protesters <unk> the headquarters for the Swedish secret police headquarters in April 2011, and during our building, they found a lot of papers.
Out of those papers was this folder called <unk>
And within that folder there were some notes from a company based in Germany that had sold the Egyptian government to intercept the communications of citizens in the country.
They sold this tool for 280 euros to the Afghan government.
The company of the company is right here.
I mean, Western governments provide the tools for governments to do this to their citizens.
But Western governments are also doing this themselves.
For example, in Germany, just a couple of weeks ago, I found the <unk> <unk> a <unk> used by the German government officials to investigate their own citizens.
If you are suspicious of a criminal case, well, it's pretty obvious that your phone is <unk>
But today it goes further.
The Internet connection to the Internet.
You know, even tools like <unk> <unk> to infect our computer with a <unk> to allow them to see all of communication, and listen online, to get our data.
When we think carefully about things like these the obvious answer should be "Well, it seems a bad thing, but it doesn't really affect me because I'm an honest citizen.
Why <unk>
I have nothing to do.
And that argument doesn't make sense.
It's in play the privacy.
privacy.
It's not a question of privacy against safety.
It's about the freedom against control.
If we could be confident in our governments today in 2011, any right to spend today, will be forever.
Would you get <unk> in any future government, in a administration that we could have within 50 years?
These are the questions that must be worried about the next 50 years.
This is where I live, I live in Kenya, in the southern Park of Nairobi.
These are the cows of my dad, the background, and behind the cows, the National Park National Park.
National Park in Nairobi doesn't have fences in the highest part of the south, which means that wild animals like <unk> migrate freely out of the park.
And predators, like the lions, and this is what they do.
We <unk> our cattle.
This is one of those who killed at night, and so soon we wake up in the morning and we found it dead -- I felt very bad because it was the only <unk> we had.
My community, the <unk> we believe we came from the sky with our animals and all the land to <unk> and so we value them so much.
So I grew up <unk> a lot of lions.
People are dying of the warriors they protect our community and the cattle, and they're also angry with the problem.
So they kill lions.
This is one of the six lions that killed in Nairobi.
I think that's so few in the National Park of Nairobi.
A child in my community, at six to nine years is responsible for the livestock of her father and this was the same thing that was happening to me.
So I had to find a way to solve this problem.
My first idea was to use fire, because I thought lions were afraid.
But I realized that this really wasn't <unk> because I even helped lions see the pen away.
I don't love <unk>
A second idea was to use a <unk>
She was trying to trick lions for they believed that I was near the <unk>
But lions are very intelligent.   they came the first day and they saw the <unk> and they were gone, but the second day, they went back and said, this thing isn't moving.  So I just jumped and killed animals.
So one night I was walking around the pen with a torch and that day the lions were gone.
I found that lions are afraid of the light that moves around.
So I had an idea.
And I got a switch on that to turn on and turn out the lights.
And this is a little light lamp from a broken lamp.
It <unk> everything.
As you can see, the solar cell load the battery and the battery -- the electricity to the small box <unk> I call it a transformational.
And the box <unk> makes the lights up.
As you can see, the <unk> get outside, because that's where lions.
And this is how lions look at when they come from night.
<unk> lights and <unk> the lions to think I'm walking around the <unk> but I'm sleeping on my bed.
Thank you.
So I put them in my home two years ago, and since then, we never got a problem with lions.
And the houses in the neighborhood have heard the idea.
One of them is this grandmother.
She had killed her many animals so many animals and asked me if I could put the lights.
I said yes.
You see them. You can see the bottom, these are the lights for lions.
Since then, I've been installed in seven houses in my community and they're serving very much.
And my idea is also used by all of Kenya, to scare other predators like <unk> <unk> and it's also being used by <unk>
Thanks to this <unk> I was fortunate to get a grant in one of the best schools in Kenya, <unk> International School, and I'm very excited.
My new school now is helping to raise funding and <unk>
It even took my friends to my community, and we set up lights in the houses that don't have them, and I teach you how to <unk>
So one year ago, I was just a boy in the meadows in the savanna <unk> the cows of my father, and I used to see flying planes and said that some day would be within one.
And here I am.
I got the opportunity to come in the plane for the first time to TED.
My great dream is to get to be a aviation engineer and a pilot when I grow up.
I used to hate the lions, but now as my invention is saving the cows of my dad and the lions, we can be with the lions without any conflict.
<unk> <unk> What in my language means, thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: You don't picture how exciting it is to listen to a story like you.
So you get a scholarship. Richard <unk> Yes.
CA: You're working on other electric inventions in the way.
What's the next in your list?
<unk> My next invention -- I want to make a fence <unk> CA: One near <unk>
<unk> I know that they were invented <unk> but I want to do mine.
CA: You know, I would give you one time, right, and <unk> <unk> I have tried it before, but I stopped because I got a <unk>  CA: On the foot, Richard <unk> are something big.
We're going to take it on every step that you have -- my friend of mine.
Thank you very much. <unk> Thank you very much.
When I was a little girl, I thought my country was the best on the planet.
And I grew up singing a song called "No <unk> anything."
And I felt very proud.
In school, we would take all the time studying the story of Kim <unk> but we never learned a lot about the rest of the world, except that America, South Korea, Japan are enemies.
Even though I sometimes wondered about the rest of the world, I thought I would spend my whole life in North Korea, until it all changed <unk>
When I was seven years old, I saw my first public <unk>
But I thought my life in North Korea was normal.
My family wasn't poor and I was never hungry.
But one day, in 1995, my mom brought home a letter from my sister.
I said, "When you get this, the five member members of the family will stop in this world, because we haven't eaten them in the last couple of weeks.
We are <unk> together on the floor, and our bodies are so weak that we're ready to die."
I was very <unk>
I was the first time I heard that people were suffering in my country.
When I was walking in front of the train station, I saw something terrible that I can't erase from my memory.
A woman who was no life was dead in the street, holding a kid in his arms looking at his face of his mother and not being able to do anything.
No one <unk> them because they were very concerned about taking care of themselves and their families.
A huge famine would lead to North Korea in the <unk>
In the end, over a million North Koreans died during famine and only found eating grass, insects and <unk>
They also became more and more frequent <unk> all the energy <unk> all around me was completely dark at night except for the sea lights in China, just crossing the river from my house.
I always wondered why they had light and we don't.
This is a picture of North Korea at night compared to the neighboring countries.
This is the <unk> River, which serves the limit of North Korea and China.
As you can see, the river can be very <unk> in certain points, allowing North Koreans to cross <unk>
But many people die.
Sometimes, I saw bodies floating in the river.
I can't tell you the details of how I left North Korea, but I can only say that during the age of famine I was sent to China to live with relatives <unk>
But I just thought I'd be separated from my family for the short time.
I could never have imagined that I would take 14 years to live together.
In China, it was difficult to live as a young woman without my family.
I had no idea what life was like refugee <unk>
But soon I learned that it's not just extremely difficult, but dangerous, because the refugees North China were considered illegal <unk>
So I was living with a constant fear that my identity was <unk> and it would be <unk> to a horrible fate in North Korea.
One day, my worst nightmare was made of reality, when I was arrested for the Chinese police and <unk> on the police station.
Somebody had been accused by being <unk> then I went through my skills in Chinese language, and asked me a lot of questions.
I was <unk>
I thought my heart was going to explode.
If you didn't seem natural, it could be incarcerated and <unk>
I thought my life was going to end.
But I managed to control my emotions and answer the questions.
At the end of the <unk> a officer told another, "This was a fake <unk> She's not <unk>
And they let me go. It was a miracle.
Some North Koreans are looking for <unk> <unk>
But many people can be arrested for Chinese police and <unk>
These women were very lucky.
Even though there were <unk> they were eventually released after a hard international pressure.
These North Koreans were not so lucky.
Every year, countless North Koreans are captured in China and <unk> to North Korea, where they're <unk> imprisoned or executed in public.
Though I was lucky to escape many other North Koreans haven't had so much luck.
It's tragic that North Koreans have to hide their identities and fight so hard to survive.
Even after learning a new language and finding work, all his world can be made in a second.
That's why, after 10 years of hide my identity, I decided to take it to South Korea.
And I started a new life again.
<unk> in South Korea was a much greater challenge of what I expected.
English was very important in South Korea, I had to start learning my third language.
Also, I understood that there was a big gap between North and South Asia.
We are all <unk> but inside, we've come to be very different because of 67 years of <unk>
And I even went through an identity.
I'm a <unk> or <unk>
Where am I? Who am I?
Suddenly there was no country I could call my pride for me.
Although I went to life in South Korea wasn't easy, I made a plan. I started to study for the peace test to college.
Just when I was starting to <unk> my new life, I got an alarming call.
The North Korean authorities had a little bit of money that sent my family to my family, and as punishment, my family was going to be shifted to the force to a remote location in the <unk>
They had to flee immediately.
I started planning how to help them escape.
The North Koreans have to travel long distances on the way to freedom.
It's almost impossible to cross the border between North Korea and South Africa.
So, ironically, I took a flight to China and went to the border to North Korea.
Because my family couldn't speak Chinese, I had to put it in a way, over three thousand miles through China and then through Southeast Asia.
The journey in <unk> took a week, and we were just caught up several times.
Once, our bus was stopped and tackled by a Chinese police officer.
He asked them all the <unk> and he started asking them questions.
As my family couldn't understand Chinese, I thought my family would be arrested.
When the Chinese officer came up to my family, <unk> and I told him that they were <unk> people who were <unk>
And I looked at <unk> but I was thankfully actually.
We did all the way to the border of <unk>
But I had to spend almost all of my money to bribe the guards <unk> in <unk>
But even after the border, my family was arrested and incarcerated to cross the <unk>
After buying <unk> and bribes, my family was released in a month.
But the time, my family was arrested and incarcerated again in the capital of <unk>
This was one of the lowest points in my life.
I made everything to release my family, and we were so close -- but my family was <unk> in prison to short distance from the embassy of South Korea.
I was going and came between the immigration office and the police station, desperately trying to release my family.
But I didn't have enough money to pay more bribes or <unk>
I lost hope.
At that time, or a voice of a man ask me, "What is the problem?"
I was so surprised that a stranger would mind to ask.
With my poor English and a dictionary, I was able to tell him the situation, and not <unk> the man was the <unk> and he gave me the rest of the money for my family and the other North Koreans and take them out of prison.
I read it with my whole heart, and I said, "Why would I <unk>
"I am not <unk> he said.
"I am helping the <unk> town.
I realized that was a symbolic moment in my life.
The kind of <unk> <unk> a new hope for me and for the <unk> people when they did it.
And I showed me that the goodness of strangers and the support of the international community are really the rays of hope that the people <unk> needs.
Over time, after our <unk> journey, my family and I met in South Korea, and I came to us.
But achieve freedom is only half the battle.
Many North Koreans are separated from their families, and when they go to a new country, they start with little or no money.
So we can benefit from the international community with education, practice in the English language practice and more.
We can also act like bridge between people in North Korea and the rest of the world.
Because many of us are still in contact with family with <unk> and we send information and money that is helping to change North Korea from the inside.
I've been very <unk> I've gotten a lot of help and inspiration in my life, so I want to help North Koreans an opportunity for international support.
I'm sure you're going to see more and more North Koreans <unk> around the world, including on the TED stage.
Thank you.
I live in <unk>
This is <unk> <unk> stores of <unk> fast food <unk>
So the city planners came together and thought, we're going to change the South Cancer name so that it represents something else, so they changed to Los Angeles as if this is <unk> what's actually wrong in the city.
This is Los Angeles --  -- <unk> <unk> quick food <unk>
Just like <unk> millions of other Americans, living in a desert desert L.A., Los Australian home to food places to take and eat in the car.
The curious thing is that food places to kill 5,000 people in the car.
People are dying of heart disease in L.A.
For example, the obesity rate in my neighborhood is five times larger than, say, <unk> <unk> which is about 15 miles away.
I emphasize this happening.
And I ask myself, how would you feel if you didn't have access to healthy food, and if every time they come out of home you see the <unk> effects that the current food system has in your <unk>
I see chairs of wheels and sold out like cars <unk>
I see temporary <unk> centers like <unk>
And I think this must stop.
I think the problem is the solution.
The food is the problem, and it's the solution.
And also, I got tired of driving 45 minutes back and back to buy an apple that doesn't have any pesticide <unk>
What I did, was planting a food forest in front of my house.
In a sliver of Earth we call a <unk>
This is 45 feet x three feet.
The point is, that belongs to the city.
But you have to <unk>
I said, "Well, I can do what I'm going to come up with me because it's my responsibility and I have to take it up.
That's how I decided to <unk>
So my group and I, L.A. Green <unk> we come together and start planting our forest of food, <unk> trees -- you know, nine vegetables down.
What we do, we are kind of a <unk> group made up by gardeners of all the <unk> of all the city and completely volunteer, and all we do is free.
And the garden, was beautiful.
Then someone gets <unk>
The city got me on top and <unk> they gave me a <unk> saying that I had to remove my garden, <unk> <unk> <unk>
And I said, "Come on, right?
A court court for planting food on a piece of land that no one would be <unk>  So I was like, "Well, let's get it."
Because this time wasn't going to happen.
L.A. Times had the story written by Steve <unk> and talked to the <unk> and one of the members of Green <unk> who put a petition in <unk> with 900 <unk> and we were a success.
We had the victory in our hands.
My <unk> even called to say that <unk> and <unk> what we were doing.
I mean, we go, why not?
L.A. is the city of the U.S. more <unk>
It's got 68 miles of <unk>
That's about 20 Central <unk>
That's enough space to plant <unk> billion blood plants.
Why on earth don't you look good at this?
We put a plant to give a few thousand seeds.
When a dollar of <unk> will give you 75 dollars a result.
It's my <unk> when I tell people, cultivate your own food.
<unk> your own food is like print your own money.
You see, I have a legacy for <unk>
I grew up there. Tell my children there.
I would love to be part of this <unk> reality that was <unk> for me, and I'm going to give you my own reality.
You see, I'm an artist.
<unk> is my <unk> I culture my art.
Such a <unk> artist <unk> walls, I <unk> soils, <unk>
I use the garden, the land, like a piece of canvas, and the plants and the trees, are my <unk>
You get rid of what the Earth can do, if they let it be their canvas.
You just can't imagine how amazing it is a sunflower and how people affect people.
What happened?
I witnessed how my garden became a education tool of my neighborhood.
To change the community, you have to change the composition of the earth.
We are the land.
You can see how they affect kids.
<unk> is the most <unk> and provocative act that can be done, especially in a <unk>
Also, you get <unk>
I remember one occasion, who came up with a mother and her daughter, and they were like <unk> overnight.
I, man, I felt bad that they were there, and I said, you know, you don't have to do this like this.
This is on the street for a reason.
I felt embarrassment to see people who were so close to me with hungry, and this only reinforces why I do this, people ask me, <unk> don't temes people go to steal your <unk>
I say, "Why don't I fear you go to <unk>
That's why it's on the street.
That's what it's about.
I want the <unk> but at the time, I want you to hold your <unk>
There was another occasion that I put a garden in a homeless shelter in <unk>
They were these guys, who helped me download the truck.
It was great, they shared their stories about how this was affected and how this was affected with her mom and her grandmother, and it was great to see how it changed, and it was just for a moment.
So Green <unk> has come to plant maybe 20 <unk>
We've had, like about 50 people who are coming, they work and <unk> all in plan.
If kids are growing <unk> the kids are eating <unk>
If none of them will eat tomatoes, <unk> --  But if none of these are <unk> if you're not taught how the food affects your mind and the body, eat blind what you put in front of you.
I see young people who want to work, but they have this thing in which they're stuck in, I see these guys who are on this path designed for them, that it doesn't take them nowhere.
With the <unk> I see an opportunity where we can train these guys to move from their communities to have a sustainable life.
And when we do this, who knows?
Maybe the next George Washington will be made.
But if we don't change the composition of the land, we never will.
Now this is one of my plans, this is something I want to do.
I want to plant a whole block of gardens, where people can share food in the same block.
I want to take containers and turn them into <unk> healthy.
I don't care about it.
I'm not talking about free, because it's not sustainable.
The funny thing about sustainability, you have to <unk>
So what I talk about is putting people out of the street, taking the kids out of the street, who know the joy, the pride and the honor of growing their own food, by opening markets.
What I want to do here, we have to make it sexy.
I want everybody to become <unk> <unk> <unk> gardeners <unk>
We need to change the script of what's a <unk>
If you're not a <unk> you're not a <unk>
What are you going to pick up your <unk> OK?
That is your weapon of choice.
In <unk> if you want to meet with me, well, if you want to see me, I don't call me -- if you want to sit in fine chairs and have meetings to talk to you some <unk> to talk about making some shit.
If you want to see me, come to the garden with your <unk> so that we can plant something.
Peace Thank you.
Thank you.
<unk> <unk> <unk>  You probably all agree with me that this is a very <unk> road <unk>
It's made from <unk> and asphalt is a good material to drive, but not always, especially in days like today, in which it rains a lot.
You can have a lot of water on the asphalt that we <unk>
And especially if you go into your bicycle and these cars go down, that's not really nice.
Also, the asphalt can make a lot of noise.
It's a noisy material, and if we build roads, like the Netherlands, very close to cities, we want a quiet road.
The solution to that is to make trails on asphalt roads.
The asphalt allows a material that we use now in most of the roads in the Netherlands, and has pores and water can go through it, so all the water of rain will flow across the sides and you have a road that is easy to drive, and not <unk> water never more.
Noise will also disappear in these <unk>
Because it's very open, all the noise disappear, so it's a very quiet road a <unk>
It also has a <unk> of course, and the disadvantage of this road is that you can <unk>
What is <unk> Look at this <unk> <unk> <unk>
First, a stone, then several more and more, and then on, and then -- well, I won't do that.  But you can harm your <unk> and you won't be happy with that.
And finally, this can also lead to more and more damage.
Sometimes they can create bumps with that.
<unk> It's ready.
<unk> of course, you can become a problem, but we have a solution.
Here you can really see how damage damage in this material.
It's a asphalt asphalt as I said, so it only has a small amount of <unk> between stones.
Because of the <unk> of <unk> light to <unk> this <unk> this <unk> the glue between the <unk> are <unk> and if they were <unk> they will be <unk> and <unk>
So if you drive the road, you will take the <unk> like we saw it here.
To solve this problem, we think of materials from <unk>
If we can make this material, then we probably have a solution.
So what we can do is use wool wool from that to clean <unk> and we can cut off the steel wool into little pieces, and we can mix these little bits with the <unk>
So we have asphalt asphalt with little pieces of steel into it.
Then you need a machine, like the one you see here, that you use to <unk> a <unk> machine.
<unk> can heat, especially steel -- it's very good at that.
So what you have to do is you heat the steel, melt the <unk> the <unk> the <unk> flow through these <unk> and all the rocks go back to the surface.
Today I used a microwave <unk> because I can't bring the great <unk> machine here on the stage.
The microwave oven, is a similar system.
I put the show I'm now going to take to see what happened.
This is the sample that comes out now.
I said we have this kind of industrial machine in the lab to heat the samples.
So we tried lots of samples out there and then the government, they really saw our results, and they thought, "Well, that's very interesting. We have to <unk>
So we gave us a piece of road, 400 meters of the <unk> highway, which we had to do a <unk> <unk> to test this material.
So that's what we did there. You see where we were doing the test on the road, and then, of course, this road will last several years without any damage. That's what we know about practice.
We take a lot of samples from this road and test them in the lab.
We did aging the samples, we put a lot of burden on them, and we <unk> them and then with our <unk> machine and <unk> and we get them out.
We can repeat this many times.
Well, to conclude, I can tell you that we've done a material using fibers of steel, incorporating these fibers, using the energy of <unk> to actually increase the lives of the road, even to actually increase the life of the surface -- they can actually save a lot of money with very simple tricks.
And now, of course, they are curious about whether it also worked.
We still have the sample here. It's pretty hot.
And actually, you have to cool first before I can show you how I can play it.
But I'm going to do a try.
Let's see. Yes, it worked.
Thank you.
When I was 11 years old, I remember having woken up one morning with the sound of the <unk> in my house.
My father was listening BBC in his little gray radius.
He had a great smile on her face which was unusual at those times, because the news is usually <unk>
"The Taliban <unk> I screamed my father.
I didn't know what to do, but I could see my father was very, very happy.
"Now you can go to a <unk> school he said.
One morning I will never forget.
A real school.
You see, I was six years old when the Taliban were <unk> from Afghanistan and made it illegal for girls to be at school.
For the next five years, I was <unk> as a kid to <unk> my older sister who could no longer be used alone to go to a secret school.
It was the only way that the two could be <unk>
Every day, we would take a different route so that no one could be suspicious where you are."
We had to hide the books on market bags for it to look like that we go shopping.
The school was at a house, more than 100 in a small room.
It was nice in the winter, but extremely <unk> in the summer.
We all knew that <unk> our life -- the teacher, the students and our parents.
Occasionally a school suddenly suddenly suddenly a week, because the Taliban <unk>
We always wondered what they knew about us.
They were <unk>
Did you know where you are."
We were <unk> but still, school was where we wanted to be.
I was very lucky to grow up in a family where education was <unk> and the daughters a <unk>
My grandfather was an extraordinary man for his time.
A total <unk> of a remote province of Afghanistan, <unk> in that his daughter, my mother, went to school, and so her father would get it.
But my educated mother became a teacher.
This is her.
It took two years ago, just to turn our home into school for girls and women in our neighborhood.
And my father, this is, was the first of her family in getting education.
There was no doubt that their children had to receive education, even their daughters, despite the <unk> despite the risks.
For him, there was a greater risk not to educate her children.
During the years of <unk> I remember there were times when I was very frustrated by our life, and she was always scared and I didn't see a future.
I wanted to give up, but my father said, <unk> daughter -- you can lose everything you have in life.
You can steal your money, you can tell you to leave your house during a war.
But there's one thing that always will be with you, what is here and if we need to sell our blood to pay your education, we'll do it.
So you don't want to do it."
I'm 22 years old.
I grew up in a country that's been destroyed by decades of war.
Less than six percent of women in my age have more than <unk> and if my family had not been so committed to my education, I would be one of them.
Instead, I find myself proud to graduate at <unk> College.
When I went back to Afghanistan, my grandfather, which was <unk> from her home for the bravery of educate his daughters, was one of the first in <unk>
He wasn't just <unk> in my university degree, but I was the first woman, and I'm the first woman, and I take it on the streets of Kabul.
My family believe in me.
I dream in big, but my family has even bigger dreams for <unk>
That's why I'm the global ambassador for <unk> a global campaign to educate women.
That's why <unk> <unk> the first and maybe private school for girls in Afghanistan, a country where it's still risky for girls to go to school.
The exciting thing is that I see students in my school with the strong desire to leverage the opportunity.
And I see their parents and their families who, like my friend, <unk> them for them, even though in the face of a <unk> opposition.
As a <unk> it's not your true name, and I can't show you your face, but Ahmed father of my students.
Less than a month ago, he and his daughter went out of the way back to her village, and it literally escaped from being killed by a bomb on the way, for minutes.
And when you get to your house, it's a voice -- a voice told him if she kept sending your daughter to school, would go to try.
<unk> already, if <unk> said, "but I don't harm the future of my daughter for his old and <unk> ideas."
What I've realized, in Afghanistan, and it's something that is often forgotten in the West, is that behind most people who are <unk> there is a father who recognized the value of their daughter and it sees the success of her own success.
It doesn't mean that our mothers have not been key in our success.
In fact, they are often the first <unk> compelling future of their daughters, but in the context of a society like Afghanistan, we need the support of men.
Under the <unk> the girls who went to school they count in <unk> remember, it was illegal.
But more than three million girls go to school in Afghanistan.
Afghanistan is so different from here in the U.S.
I find that Americans see the fragility of changes.
They would argue that these changes not <unk> a lot, after the retirement U.S.
But when I go back to Afghanistan, when I look at students in my school and their parents who come up with them, and I see them -- I see a <unk> future and lasting change.
For me, Afghanistan is a country of hope and possibilities -- and every day the girls of <unk> would tell me.
Like me, they dream big.
Thank you.
I've never forgotten the words of my grandmother who died in the <unk> <unk> resists <unk> <unk> against him.
But you never get a revolutionary <unk>
They've spent almost two years since the revolution broke inspired by the <unk> of <unk> <unk> both of the <unk> revolution like <unk>
A forces with many other citizens <unk> inside and outside of the country to call a day of anger and initiate a revolution against the <unk> regime of <unk>
And <unk> was a great revolution.
Women and men and men who were <unk> were at the end of the regime, each of the regime, carrying <unk> of freedom, dignity and social justice.
You have shown a copy of the face of the brutal dictatorship of <unk>
They've shown a great sense of solidarity from the <unk> East, to the West, to the south.
And finally, after a period of six months of brutal war, and a loss of about 50,000 people die, we managed to release our country and remove our country and remove the <unk>
However, <unk> left a heavy burden -- a legacy of <unk> corruption and <unk>
For four decades, the <unk> regime of <unk> destroyed the infrastructure and culture and moral structure of society.
<unk> from the devastation and the challenges, I've been asking for many other women, rebuilding the civil civil society, <unk> a inclusive and fair transition to democracy and the national reconciliation
There were about 200 organizations in <unk> <unk> and immediately after the <unk> roughly 300 in <unk>
After a period of nine years of <unk> I went back to Libya and with a unique enthusiasm I started to organize workshops about the development of capabilities and leadership skills.
With an incredible group of women we founded the Women of Women and Women <unk> by <unk> a movement of women, leaders -- to advocate for the Afghan autonomy of the woman and for our right of engaging in the building of democracy and peace.
I found myself with a very difficult environment in the <unk> environment, an environment that became more and more <unk> to be aware of the selfish policies of domination and exclusion.
Over time, our initiative was <unk>
Women won a <unk> of the National Congress in the first choices in 52 years.
However, recently, the exhilaration of elections and the revolution as a whole, were <unk> every day we found news news.
One day we woke up with the news of the <unk> of mosques in ancient mosques and <unk> <unk>
Another day <unk> with the news of the murder of the American ambassador and the attack on the <unk>
Another day we woke up with the news of the murder of officers of the army.
And every day, every day we woke up with the government of the <unk> and their <unk> human rights activists and their lack of respect for law.
Our society, made up a <unk> mindset becomes more <unk> and it's gone away from the ideals and principles of freedom, the social justice, we had the beginning.
<unk> <unk> and revenge became the icons of the consequences of revolution.
I'm not here today to get us here at all today to deal with our success for the success of <unk> <unk> and the election.
Rather, I'm here today to confess that we, as a nation, we chose <unk> we take the wrong decision.
We don't prioritize well.
Because elections didn't bring peace and stability and security to Libya.
The <unk> and the <unk> and candidate and candidate peace and reconciliation <unk>
No, they didn't.
What happened then?
Why is our society still <unk> and dominated by selfish policies of domination and <unk> for men as <unk>
Perhaps what was missing was not only women, but the female values of compassion, <unk> and <unk>
Our society needs the national dialogue and the creation of consensus more than what they needed for the election that only is polarization and <unk>
Our nation needs the <unk> representation of the female to need the <unk> representation of it.
We need to stop acting as agents of outrage and calling days of anger.
We need to start acting as agents of compassion and mercy.
We have to develop a female speech -- that not only <unk> but also put it in practice <unk> rather than <unk> collaboration in place of competition, the inclusion rather than exclusion.
These are the ideals that a Libya, <unk> for war, desperately needs to be able to reach peace.
Because peace has a alchemy that is about the interrelationship and the <unk> between the female perspectives and <unk>
That's the real <unk>
We need to set out the existential way to make it <unk>
According to a <unk> <unk> <unk> "is the word of God <unk> <unk> <unk>
At the time, the word <unk> which is known in all the traditions -- it has the same root in Arabic that the word <unk> <unk> the female and <unk> that embraces all of the humanity that men and women, that all tribes and all the towns have been <unk>
And so just like the uterus completely covers the <unk> that grows inside, the divine array of compassion is it <unk> all of us.
So he says, "My <unk> covers all the things."
So he says, "My <unk> <unk> about my <unk>
That all of them are telling you the grace of mercy.
Thank you.
I'm here today to talk to you about a question about a question that has an equally <unk> response.
It's about the secrets of domestic violence, and the question I'm going to talk about is that everybody is supposed to be left?
Why would anyone stay with a man who was <unk>
I'm not a psychiatrist, nor a social worker, no expert in domestic violence.
I'm just a woman with a story to tell.
I was 22 years old at Harvard University.
I had moved to New York for my first job as a writer and editor at <unk> magazine.
I had my first apartment, my first green <unk> American <unk> and I had a very big one.
My secret was that many, many times, the man, that I create my alma mater, me with a <unk> <unk> with bullets of <unk>
The man, when anyone in this world, put a gun in my head and <unk> with <unk> more times than I can remember.
I'm here to tell you the story of <unk> <unk> a psychological trick, of love, where every year millions of women, and even some men.
Until it could be your story.
I don't look like a typical survivor of domestic violence.
I'm a <unk> in English at Harvard University, and I have an MBA at <unk> from Harvard Business <unk>
I've spent most of my career working for companies for <unk> <unk> <unk> between them Johnson & Johnson, I read <unk> and The Washington <unk>
I have almost 20 years married my second husband and we have three children.
My dog is a black <unk> and lead a <unk> <unk> <unk>
So my first message for you is that domestic violence can happen to anyone, all races, all of all religions, all of the income levels and education.
It's everywhere.
And my second message is that everybody thinks that domestic violence happens to women, which is a problem of women.
Not exactly.
More than 85 percent of <unk> are men, and the domestic abuse just happens in relationships and <unk> and long duration or said, otherwise in the families, the last place we want or we would expect to find <unk> for which, for domestic abuse, as <unk> as <unk>
I would have told you that it would be the last person in the world that would stay with a man who <unk> it and actually I was a very typical victim due to my age.
I was 22 years old, and in the United States the women between 16 and 24 years of age have three times more likely to be victims of domestic violence than the other ages, and over the other ages, women and girls in that age are killed every year by partners, <unk> and husbands in the United States.
I also went a typical victim, because I didn't know anything about domestic violence, their warning signals or their patterns.
I met <unk> in a cold, rainy night of January.
I was sitting next to my side in the subway of New York and started <unk> me.
He told me two things.
The first one was that he had just gone from a university from the <unk> <unk> and she worked on a very important bank of Wall Street.
But what struck me most of the first encounter was that it was ready and funny, and it seemed like a field of the field.
He had some big <unk> as apples and a <unk> hair, wheat, and it seemed so sweet.
One of the smartest things he made <unk> from the beginning, was to create the illusion that I was the dominant component of the mate.
He did it all at the beginning <unk> in a <unk>
We started out and loved all of me -- which was ready -- that I had gone to Harvard, who would put passion to help teenage girls and my job.
I wanted to know everything about my family, my childhood, my dreams and illusions.
<unk> believed in me, as a writer and as a woman, as nobody had ever done before.
And it was why the degree of that <unk> school and work on Wall Street and his bright future had so much important to him.
I didn't know that the first phase in any domestic violence relationship is <unk> and <unk> to the victim.
And I didn't know that the second step is <unk>
Now, the last thing I wanted to do was to go from New York and leave my work of my dreams, but I thought I had to do sacrifices for your partner, so I did -- I quit my work and <unk> and I went together from Manhattan.
I had no idea that I was falling into a <unk> <unk> who was entering head in a physical and financial trap.
The next step in the pattern of domestic violence is to introduce violence to see how it reacts it.
And this is where those <unk> come in.
As soon as we moved to New England you know, that site where you were supposed to <unk> I had to feel so safe to buy three <unk>
One was in the <unk> of the car.
Another we kept under the pillow in our bed and the third always in his pocket.
And he said that I needed those <unk> because of the trauma that she lived from small.
I needed them to feel safe.
But those guns actually were a message for me, and although I had never lifted me my hand, my life already was serious danger, every minute of every day.
The first physical <unk> attack happened five days before our wedding.
They were the seven in the morning and I still had the <unk>
Five days later, when the 10 bruises of my neck had disappeared, I put my mother's suit in my mother and married me.
In spite of what I had occurred, I was sure that they were living happily forever, because I loved him, and he wanted me so much.
And I was very, very <unk>
It was just very <unk> by the wedding and the fact that I form a family with me.
I had been a isolated accident and I never would do harm.
I spent twice as much as our coral moon.
The first time I was driving down to a secret beach and he <unk> and he gave me so strong in the head that I had a number of times against the car <unk>
And then a couple of days later, driving back from the <unk> of honey. He went through the traffic and threw a little Mac cold into the face.
<unk> continued to <unk> one or two times a week for the next two and a half years of our marriage.
I was <unk> when I thought it was the only one in this situation.
One of every three American women is a victim of domestic violence or bullying at some point of their life, and the Center for Disease Control reports that every year 15 million children are <unk> 15 million.
So, actually, I had very good company.
Let me go back to my question: Why do I love me?
The answer is simple.
I didn't know he was abusing me.
Instead, I was a very strong woman in love with a deeply <unk> man -- and it was the only person in the world who could help <unk> to cope with the hell.
The other question that everybody is doing is, why don't they just go <unk>
Why didn't I <unk> I could have gone at any time.
For me, this is the saddest and painful question that people do, because we are the victims, we know something that you usually <unk> is incredibly dangerous to abandon a <unk>
Because the last phase in the pattern of domestic violence is to kill her.
More than 70 percent of the killings in domestic violence occur after the victim ever placed their relationship, after <unk> because then the <unk> has nothing to lose.
Other repercussions include permanent <unk> even after the <unk> has gone back to marry, <unk> from financial resources, and <unk> of the family judicial system to <unk> the victim and their children, who are usually forced by judges to spend time not with the man who <unk> their mother.
And we still keep asking why it's just not going?
I was able to go, because of one last <unk> beat that beat my denial.
I realized that the man who loved so much, would have killed me if it would be allowed.
So I broke the silence.
I told everybody around the world: the police, to my neighbors, my friends and family, full and <unk> and I'm here today because you all helped me.
We have the tendency to <unk> victims like <unk> <unk> women <unk> <unk> goods.
The question, "Why is it <unk>
For some people is a way to say <unk> is it <unk> as if the victims -- <unk> <unk> of men who want to <unk>
But since I posted <unk> <unk> I've heard hundreds of men and women who were also <unk> they learned to have learned lesson from what happened to them, and that they would bring their lives to joyful and happy lives as <unk> wives and mothers, completely free of violence, like mine.
Because it turns out that I'm actually a victim and a survivor, of domestic violence very <unk>
I came back to marry a cute man and kind and kind and you have those three children.
I have that black <unk> and also that <unk>
What I won't go back to have ever more, is a <unk> <unk> pointing to my head in someone who says it wants.
At this moment, you're just thinking, <unk> that's <unk> or <unk> what silly <unk> but all this time I have actually been talking about you.
I assure you that there are a few people who are listening to me right now, that are being <unk> or that they are being <unk> they are <unk> themselves.
The <unk> could be affecting their daughter, her <unk> her best friend right now.
I was able to end my crazy particular love <unk>
And I keep doing this today.
It's my way to help other victims, and it's my last request for you.
Talk about what you've heard here.
abuse is not only in silence.
They have the power to end domestic violence simply shedding light over it.
The victims we need all the world.
We need each of you to understand the secrets of domestic violence.
Take the abuse directly from the light talking about it with their children, their coworkers and friends and family.
<unk> their vision of survivors as fantastic people and <unk> who have a future <unk>
And we put the early signs of violence to intervene consciously, to stop their climb and show the victims a safe <unk>
And together we can turn our bed, our tables and our families in the oasis sure they should be.
Thank you.
Hi. I call me Cameron <unk> and for a while, I am a model.
It will be accurate for 10 years ago.
And I feel like right now, there's a uncomfortable tension in the room because I shouldn't have looked like this.  luckily, I brought clothes to <unk>
This is the first shift in a <unk> scenario, so you have a lot of <unk> I think.
If some of the women are <unk> when they <unk> they don't have to go on now, but find it later on Twitter.
I also want to point out that I have the privilege of being able to change what you think about me in just 10 seconds.
Not everybody has that opportunity.
These are heels.
The worst part is going to spend this sweater on your head, because it's when you're going to laugh at me, so you don't do anything as I cover my head.
All right.
Why have I done this?
It's been embarrassing.
Well, I hope not as much as this picture.
The appearance is powerful, but also <unk>
I have changed what they thought about me in six seconds.
And in this picture, I had never had a boyfriend, in real life.
I was totally uncomfortable and the photographer told me that I was going to get the back and I would get the hair out of the kid.
Of course, except with surgery or an artificial <unk> like the one that I made two days ago for the work, there are very little that we can do to transform our looks, which, even if shallow and <unk> has a huge impact on our lives.
So today, to me, being brave means to be honest.
I'm on this stage because I am a model.
Because I'm a nice, white woman, and in my workforce, that's a sexy girl.
I'm going to answer the questions that people always do, but it <unk>
The first question is, how do you get to be model?
And I always say, <unk> <unk> but that doesn't mean anything.
The real reason I made a model is because I won the genetic lottery, and I'm the <unk> of an <unk> and maybe you're wondering what this <unk> is.
Well, in the last centuries we have not only defined beauty as health, youth and symmetry, which we are biologically programmed to <unk> also that we've associated with a high and <unk> shape, and to a white skin.
And that's my <unk> heritage that I've known leverage to make money.
And I know that there are people in the public who now show <unk> and maybe there are some <unk> of the fashion that <unk> <unk> There are <unk>
First of all, <unk> to know so much of models.
But unfortunately, I have to report that in 2007, a Ph.D. student at the University of New York said all and every one of the models in the <unk> and the <unk> models -- just <unk> -- is to say, less than four percent, not white people.
The next question that people always ask me is: Can it be a model when <unk>
And my first answer is: I don't know, I don't care about that.
But then what I would tell every one of these girls is: Why? Can you be what you want.
You can be president of the United States, or the <unk> of the next Internet, or a surgeon <unk> ninja and poet, which would be awesome, because you are the first.
If after this spectacular list, I still <unk> No, no, Cameron, I want to be a model, then I say, "I know my <unk>
Because I'm not in charge of nothing, and you could be the head of <unk> <unk> or the executive executive or the next Steven <unk>
To say that you want to be a model -- it's like saying you want to win the lottery when you're larger.
It's out of your control, it's amazing, and it's not a job you can choose.
I'm going to show you all that I learned in 10 years as a model, because unlike the surgery, <unk> can be summarized right now.
I don't know what happened there.
Unfortunately, once you've heard your studies, and you have a suggestion and a little bit of work on your back, no matter what <unk> you want to be president of the United States, but your <unk> <unk> <unk> for 10 years, people would look at you weird.
The next question that people always do is if all the photos are <unk>
And yes, pretty much <unk> all the pictures, but that's just a small part of what happens.
This was the first picture I had, and also the first time I used a <unk> and I didn't even had my period.
I know we're getting into the personal domain, but it was a little girl.
So I looked at my grandmother a few months before.
These two pictures are the same day.
My friend came with me.
Here I am at a <unk> party.
Here I am with my soccer team and magazine <unk>
And this is me today.
And I hope you realize I'm not me in those photos.
These are creations of a professional team, <unk> <unk> photographers and <unk> and all their <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and they can create this. That's not me.
Well, the next question that people always ask me is, do it do for free?
I have too much about 20 inches and I never use, except the couple before, but the privilege I get is the ones I get in real life, and that we don't like to talk about.
I grew up in Cambridge, and I went to a shop and I forgot to take money, and I was given the free <unk>
When I was a teenager, I was traveling with my friend who was a <unk> <unk> he jumped into a red light and, of course, we <unk> and <unk> a sorry, agent in order to continue <unk>
<unk> of these privileges for my respect, not for what I am. And there are people who are paying a price for their aspect of no matter who they are.
I live in New York, and last year, of <unk> teenagers who were stood up and 86 percent were black and Latino -- and most of them were young men.
And there are only <unk> black and Latino men in New York, so for them, it's not a question of <unk>
It was how many times I get <unk>
In researching this talk, I learned that by 53 percent of <unk> girls in the United States don't like their body, and that figure goes up at 78 percent at 17.
So the last question people ask me is: How is life of a model?
And I think the answer you're waiting for is, if you're a little thinner and you have the brightest hair, you'll feel so happy and beautiful.
And behind the cameras, we give an answer that maybe we would have it.
<unk> It's really wonderful to travel, and also incredible to work with creative and clever people and <unk>
And that's all right, but it's just a part of what happens, because what we never say in front of the cameras, what I have never said in front of them, is: I'm insecure.
And I'm because I have to worry about my aspect every day.
And if you ever ask, with some more thin legs and the brightest hair will be happier?
They just have to meet with a group of models, because they have the most <unk> legs, the brighter hair and clothes that are probably the most insecure women on the planet.
But mostly it was hard to analyze a situation of racial oppression and gender when I am one of the biggest <unk>
If there is something that is going to keep in this talk, I hope everyone feels more comfortable to recognize the power of the image in the perception that we have of success and failure.
Thank you.
The photograph has been my passion since I was much older enough to support a camera, but today I want to share with you my 15 pictures more <unk> and I didn't get the <unk>
There was no directors or <unk> no opportunity to repeat the photos, even even a minimum amount of care in the lighting.
In fact, most of the shots took random disease.
My story begins and <unk> in New York City to give a <unk> my wife pulled me out this picture holding my daughter on his first birthday. That's the <unk> corner of the <unk>
He happened to get back to New York just a year later, so we decided to take the same picture.
Well, you can imagine what's coming now.
When the third birthday of my daughter, my wife told me, why don't you take you to New York on a <unk> journey, and you drive the <unk>
This is when we started to ask the tourists that would happen to <unk> the picture.
It's amazing that the gesture of delivering the camera to a whole stranger is so universal.
No one has been denied and, fortunately, no one has <unk> with the camera.
So we weren't aware of how much life would change this journey.
It became something sacred for us.
This picture is a few weeks after the <unk> and I had to explain to my daughter what had happened that day as a five year-old girl could be understood.
These pictures are much more than full of a particular moment or a specific journey.
It's also a way to stop the time in a week from October and to make us reflect on our time and our evolution over the years, not just the physical level, but in all the senses.
Because, even though we always take the same picture, our perspective changes, my daughter changes, new <unk> and I can see life through your eyes and how they perceive and interact with everything.
That particular time that we spend together is something we hope with illusion all year.
So recently, in one of the trips of travel, we were walking around, when all of a sudden it was stopped in the dry and pointed out a red <unk> of the baby shop that <unk> a little bit of <unk>
And he described to me what there was a sense of five years standing at that same place.
<unk> that I remembered their heart <unk> with force to see that place for the first time nine years ago.
And now what you look at in New York are universities, because it's determined to study in New York.
And I suddenly understood that one of the most important things we create is the memories.
So I want to share the idea of actively engaging in the conscious creation of memories.
I don't know about you, but apart from these 15 pictures, I don't get out of many family pictures.
I'm always getting out the picture.
Today I want to encourage all of you to come up in the picture, and I don't want to go close to somebody and ask him, and you get a <unk>
Thank you.
I want to talk to you about a very special group.
There are 10,000 species of birds in the world.
<unk> are found in the most <unk> birds.
First of all, why do they have so bad <unk>
It has also been associated with Disney laughs as characters.
More recently, if you've been following the press -- laughter, applause and <unk> these are the attributes that associate with Parliament <unk> but I don't accept it.
I don't accept it. You know why?
Because the members of Parliament don't clean the environment --  <unk> not help prevent the spread of disease.
<unk> are <unk>   You are far from <unk>  And my favorite, the <unk> have better presence.
There are the <unk> from the New World World that are mainly in the <unk> like the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and the World <unk> where we have 16 species of these 16, 11 face a high risk of extinction.
So why are you <unk> First of all, they provide ecological services, vital services.
It's our natural garbage <unk>
They <unk> the cadavers to the bone.
They help kill all the bacteria. They help to absorb the anthrax that not to be caused by them would stretch out and caused large losses to livestock and diseases in other animals.
Recent studies have shown that in areas where there are no <unk> the carcasses are three to four times more time in <unk> and this has huge branching into the spread of disease.
<unk> also have huge important importance.
They've been associated with ancient culture <unk>
<unk> was the symbol of the protective and the maternity and along with the <unk> <unk> the unit between the High and the Lower Egypt.
In the mythology of <unk> <unk> was the god <unk> and risked his life to save the <unk> Tasmanian devil god.
In <unk> culture, they are doing very important <unk> to open sky -- in places like Tibet, -- there's no place to bury the dead or wood or wood to <unk> so these <unk> provide a natural elimination system.
What's the problem with <unk>
We have eight species of <unk> in Kenya, of which six are at extreme <unk>
The reason is that they're being <unk> and the reason they're being <unk> is because there is conflicts between humans and <unk> <unk> communities use this venom against predators, and as a consequence, <unk> are victims of this.
In South Asia, in countries like India and Pakistan, like India and Pakistan, four species of <unk> are on the danger criticism -- which means that in less than 10 or 15 years is <unk> and the reason is because they fall prey to use livestock consumption that has been treated with a <unk> drug like <unk>
This drug has been banned to use vet in India and have taken a statement.
Since there is no <unk> there has been a spread in the number of dogs on the street <unk> and when you have dogs -- you have a huge amount of time for <unk> the number of cases of anger has increased enormously in India.
Kenya is going to have one of the biggest wind farms in Africa: <unk> <unk> are going to be up from Lake <unk>
I'm not against wind energy, but we have to work with governments, because wind turbines do this to birds. They cut it in half.
They're <unk> of birds.
In West Africa, there is a horrible <unk> trade trade to serve the <unk> and the <unk> market.
So what are you doing? Well, we're researching these birds. We are looking at these birds.
We're trying to determine their basic ecology, and see where they go.
We can see that travel through different countries, so to focus on a locally problem that's not going to be at all.
We need to work with governments at the regional level.
We're working with local communities.
We're talking to them about appreciating the <unk> about the need to appreciate these wonderful creatures and the services that we <unk>
How can you help? It can become assets, make noise. You can write a letter to your government and tell you we need to focus on these very <unk> creatures.
When you leave out of this room, you will tell you about the <unk> but talk to your families, with their children, with their neighbors on the <unk>
They are very <unk> Charles Darwin said that he changed it because he saw it without effort, no energy spending in the heavens.
Kenya, this world, will be much more poor without these wonderful species.
Thank you very much.
Every single thing I do and all I do -- my life -- it's been <unk> for seven years of work during my youth in Africa.
From <unk> to <unk> <unk> young people, but I am not.  I worked in Zambia, Kenya, East <unk> and Somalia.
I worked for a <unk> NGO and every project that we set up in sub-Saharan Africa.
And I was <unk>
<unk> to the 21, that Italians were good people, and we were doing a good job in Africa.
Instead of that, all you have to do, the <unk>
Our first project, which inspired my first book, <unk> from <unk> was a project where a few Italians decided to teach people about Zambia to grow food.
So we get with <unk> <unk> in the south of Zambia to this absolutely wonderful valley that goes down to the <unk> River, and we teach the local local tomatoes to grow Italians and <unk> and ...
Of course, people were not at all interested in doing that, because of what they asked them to come to work, and sometimes they were not <unk>  We were amazed than the local in as fertile valley, had not had agriculture.
However, instead of asking you how it was possible that we would not make anything, we just said, "Thank God that we're here."  <unk> time to save the people of Zambia from <unk>
And of course, everything in Africa was grown <unk>
We got these magnificent <unk> in Italy, a dead fit in this size. In Zambia, to this size.
And we couldn't believe it, we were telling the <unk> "Look at <unk> "Look at the <unk> "Look at the <unk>
When tomatoes were beautiful, <unk> and red <unk> at night in the morning, about 200 <unk> appeared in the river and ate it.  And we said to the <unk> "Oh my God, the <unk>
And the <unk> said, "Yeah, that's why we don't have agriculture here."  "Why don't you go, "You're never <unk>
I thought that only we had the Italians make mistakes in Africa, but then I saw what the Americans, they did the <unk> what the French did, and after seeing what they were doing, I felt quite proud of our project in Zambia.
Because, as you see, at least we feed the <unk>
You can see the <unk> --  -- <unk> seeing the waste that they give you to the <unk> people of Africa.
She wants to read a book, read <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
The book was published in 2009.
We, Western countries, we've given the African continent two million dollars in the last 50 years.
Don't tell you about damage that money has <unk>
Just read your book.
<unk> of an African woman, the damage we've done.
The Westerners are <unk> missionaries missionaries and we treat people only two things: or <unk> or <unk> or <unk>
The two words come from the Latin root of the Latin root that means <unk>
But they mean two different things.
<unk> I treat any of a different culture as if it was my children, I want a lot."
<unk> I treat all of a different culture as if they were my <unk>
So white people in Africa are called <unk> <unk>
That book gave me a slap in the face of the face, "The little thing is <unk> written by <unk> who said for all economic development, if people don't want to be <unk> <unk> alone.
This should be the first principle of help.
The first principle of aid is <unk>
This morning, Mr. who opened this conference put on this conference put a stick on the floor and said, we can -- you can imagine a city that is not <unk>
I decided to the age of 27 years just answering the people, and I invented a system called <unk> <unk> where you never start anything, you ever have one another, but it becomes a <unk> of the local passion, the <unk> of the local people who have the dream of becoming a better person.
So what do you do? It <unk>
It will never come to a community with an idea, and you sit with the people of the <unk>
We don't work from the offices.
We sat at a cafe. We sat down at a bar.
We have zero infrastructure.
And what do we do? We become friends, and we found what the person wants to do.
The most important thing is the passion.
You can give an idea to somebody.
If that person doesn't want to do that, what's going to do you?
The passion that she has for its own growth is the most important thing.
The passion that that man has for her own personal growth is the most important one.
And then we help them find the knowledge because no one in the world can be successful alone.
The person with the idea may not have the knowledge, but knowledge is available.
So years and years ago, I had this idea: Why not us, for once instead of getting to a community to tell people what to do, why no, for once, for once, but not in meetings within them.
Let me tell you a secret.
There's a problem with <unk>
The entrepreneurs never <unk> and they will never tell you in a public meeting, what they want to do with their own money, what do they have been identified.
So, planning has this point.
The smartest people in their community, you don't even know it, because they don't go to their public meetings.
What do we do? So what do we do? We work on a face -- you have to create social infrastructure which doesn't exist.
You must create a new profession.
The profession is the business doctor of the company, the family physician in the business, who sets up with you at your house, at the table of his kitchen table, and that helps him find the resources to transform her passion in a way of living.
I started this as a test in <unk> city of Western Australia.
I was doing a Ph.D. at the time, trying to move away from this <unk> junk -- where we got to tell you what to do.
In a year, I had 27 projects going on, and the government came to me to see to ask: "How can you do that?
How can you do it?" And I said, "I did something very, very difficult.
I would love and tell you.  So --  So the government says, <unk> again.  We've done it in 300 communities in the world.
We've helped start 40,000 businesses.
There's a new generation of entrepreneurs who are dying of loneliness.
Peter <unk> one of the greatest business advisers in history passed away a few years ago.
Peter <unk> was a professor of philosophy before they get involved in business, and this is what Peter <unk> says is incompatible with a society and a <unk> economy.
Passion is the kiss of the death of the business spirit.
So now we <unk> rebuilding <unk> without knowing what most <unk> people in <unk> want to do with their own money and their own energy.
You have to learn how to get these people to talk to you.
You have to give you a privacy, privacy, it has to be fantastic for the help and then <unk> will come in mass.
In a community of 10,000 people, we get 200 customers.
You can imagine a community of 400,000 people, intelligence and passion?
What are you going to show you more this morning.
<unk> <unk> That's what you have <unk>
So what I tell you is that the entrepreneurial spirit is where the entrepreneurial spirit is.
We are at the end of the first industrial revolution -- fossil <unk> not renewable <unk> and from one point to another, we have systems that are not sustainable.
The internal combustion engine is not sustainable.
<unk> as a way of sustaining <unk> is not sustainable.
What we have to consider, is how we do -- <unk> <unk> <unk> to communicate to seven billion people, in a sustainable way.
There are no technologies to do that.
Who is going to invent technology for the green revolution, <unk> <unk>
The government?
They'll be the entrepreneurs and they're doing it now.
There's a lovely story that was in a <unk> magazine many, many years ago.
There was a group of experts who were invited to debate the future of New York City in the year <unk>
And in the year <unk> they got together this group of people, and <unk> about what happened to New York City in 100 years, and the conclusion was <unk> the city of New York would not be within 100 years.
Why? Because they analyzed the curve and <unk> if the population keeps growing up to this <unk> to move the population of New York to <unk> <unk> six million horses, and the manure produced by six million horses that would be impossible to address.
They were already <unk> in dung.  And so in <unk> they were <unk> this dirty technology that <unk> life in New York.
So what happens? In the next 40 years, in the United States in the United States are <unk> <unk> robotic companies <unk>
The idea of finding a different technology was absolutely <unk> and there were very little, <unk> factories in <unk> places.
<unk> Michigan.
However, there's a secret to work with the entrepreneurs.
First, you have to give you <unk>
Otherwise you're not going to come with you with you.
And then you have to give you an absolute dedicated service, <unk>
And then you will have to tell you the truth with respect to <unk>
The smaller company, the bigger company has to be able to do three things -- the product that you want to sell you has to be fantastic, you have to tell with a fantastic marketing -- and you have to tell a great financial administration and you have to tell with a great financial administration.
Do you know what?
We've never met a single human being in the world that can do, sell and look for money alone.
It doesn't exist.
This is still not born.
We've looked at it, and looked at the 100 companies coming from the Carnegie <unk> <unk> Ford, all of the new companies, Google <unk>
There's only one thing that all of the successful companies in the world have in common, only one: no one was started by one person.
I would never have the word <unk> but the word <unk> 32 times.
He wasn't just when he started.
No one begins a company alone.
So we can create the community where we have <unk> who come from a small business environment in <unk> in the bars and their dedicated <unk> who will do for you, what someone did for this gentleman who is talking about this <unk> someone who will ask you, what do you need?
What can you? Can you do it?
All right, can you look at the <unk>
"Oh, no, I can't do that."
We activate communities.
Thank you.
Those around us are helping us in many ways to improve our lives.
We don't know all the neighbors, so that's why not much knowledge in spite of sharing the same public spaces.
In the last few years, I've been trying to share more with my neighbors in the public space with simple tools like <unk> <unk> and chalk.
These projects came from questions like, how much paid my neighbors for their <unk>
How can we pay and request more things without calling the door to a <unk>
How do we share more memories of our abandoned buildings, and better understanding our <unk>
How do we share more our hopes for stores to empty stores so that our communities can reflect with our needs and <unk>
I live in New York City, and I'm in love with New <unk>
My soul will always find relief with the giant <unk> that you get shadow to <unk> <unk> and <unk> for centuries and I trust a city.
It always gives to the music.  There is a parade in New <unk>  The city has one of the most beautiful architecture in the world, but also one with the largest number of abandoned <unk>
I live near this house, and I thought how I could turn it into a more nice space for the neighborhood, and also in something that changed my life forever.
In 2009, I lost someone who loved a lot.
It was <unk> as a mother to <unk>
His death was suddenly suddenly and unexpected.
I thought a lot about death and so.
And this was a profound gratitude for the time and lived in my life.
It tells the significant things about my current life.
But let's try to keep this look in my everyday life.
It seems to me that it's easy to be able to catch the day and forget what's really important for you.
So with the help of old and new friends transformed the wall of this abandoned house on a giant slate and painted about her phrases for <unk> "Before she died <unk>
So the <unk> could take a <unk> to reflect on their lives and share personal aspirations in public space.
I didn't know what to wait for this experiment, but the next day the wall was full and still <unk>
And I'd like to share some things that people wrote on the wall.
Before I die I want to be <unk> by <unk>  Before I die, I want to sit <unk> on the line of <unk>
Before I die I want to sing for millions of people."
Before you die I want to plant a <unk>
Before I die I want to live outside the <unk>
Before I die I want to give you one more time more."
Before I die I want to go to <unk> rescue.
Before I die I want to be completely myself."
This abandoned space became constructive and the dreams and hope for people to get me laughing at me, and they gave me comfort in difficult times.
It's about knowing that you're not alone. It's trying to understand our neighbors in new ways and <unk> -- it's about giving <unk> the reflection and <unk> and remembering what is most important for us as we grow and we change ourselves.
This happened last year and I started getting hundreds of people from passionate people who wanted to make a wall in their community.
And so with my colleagues in the civic center we did a kit and now they've made up walls in countries around the world, like Kazakhstan, South Africa, Australia, Argentina and beyond.
Together we showed the power of our public spaces if they give us an opportunity to express ourselves and share each other.
Two of the most valuable things we have is time and our relationships with other people.
In our era of <unk> distractions it is more important than ever before, finding the ways to preserve the perspective and to remember that life is short and fragile.
The death is something we often avoid talking about, or even to think, but I understood that we were being prepared for death is one of those things that make us more power.
You think about death -- our life will be done.
Our shared spaces can reflect better what we care about as individuals and as a community and more media to share hopes, fears and stories, people around us can't only help improve places, can help improve our lives.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Today I have a single request.
Please don't tell me that I'm normal.
Now I'd like to introduce you to my brothers.
<unk> has 22 years old, it's high and very <unk>
Not speak, but transmits joy that some of the best speakers.
<unk> knows what love.
It's shared. <unk> happen to what happens.
It's not <unk> You don't look at the color of the skin.
They don't care religious differences and look at this: It's never <unk>
When singing songs from our childhood, trying to talk the words that I can't even <unk> it reminds me of one thing: which we know about the mind and how wonderful it must be the unknown.
Samuel is 16 years old. It's very <unk>
We would have more <unk> memory <unk>
However, it's a selective memory.
It doesn't remember if I stole my <unk> but remember the year that he came out every single songs of my iPod, conversations that we kept when I was four years old, I would pee in my arm during the first episode of the <unk> and the birthday <unk> birthday.
You don't think amazing?
But most people disagree with.
And in fact, because their minds don't fit into the <unk> concept of society, they're often <unk> and <unk>
But what propelled my heart and <unk> my soul was that even if that was the case, although you wouldn't consider them within it, that could only mean one thing: which was autistic and autistic people.
Now, for those less familiar term, the term <unk> is a complex brain disorder affecting social communication, learning and sometimes the physical skills.
In every individual it manifests itself in a different way, so that it will be so different to Sam.
And all over the world, every 20 minutes, we are diagnosed with a new case of autism, and although it's one of the development disorders that are faster in the world, there is no cause of <unk>
I don't remember my first encounter with autism, but I don't remember one day without him.
I had only three years when my brother came to the world, and I was very excited to have a new being in my life.
When I spent a few months, I realized he was different.
<unk> a lot.
I didn't want to play like the other babies and in fact, didn't seem very interested in me at all.
He was living and <unk> in his own world, with their own rules, and he was pleasure in the smallest things, like putting cars in row around the room, looking at the machine and eat the machine and eating any thing that you have <unk>
As I grew up, it would become more different, and the differences were made more <unk>
But beyond the <unk> the frustration and the <unk> <unk> had something really <unk> a pure and innocent nature of the world who saw the world without <unk> a human being that had never been <unk>
<unk>
I can't deny that there have been some difficult moments in my family, moments in which I wish they were just like me.
But I look back at the things that have taught me about individuality, and communication and love, and I realize they're things that I wouldn't want to change by normal.
<unk> happens to the high beauty of beauty that give us the differences and the fact of being different doesn't mean that some of them are wrong.
It just means there's a different view of what's right.
If I could <unk> one thing to <unk> and to Sam and you don't have to be normal.
They can be extraordinary.
Because, autistic or not, the differences that <unk> -- they're a <unk> Each of us has a gift in your inner and, honestly, the pursuit of normality, is the last sacrifice of the potential.
The opportunity for <unk> progress and change dies at the moment that we try to be like others.
Please don't tell me that I'm normal.
Thank you.
Five years ago, I experienced a little bit what must have been <unk> in the country of <unk>
Penn State asked me to a communications teacher to give a kind of communication to engineering students.
I was scared.  <unk> really <unk> <unk> of these students with their big minds, their big books and their big <unk>
But when we develop those conversations -- I felt what <unk> should have felt when he fell through the <unk> hole and saw the door of a new world.
I felt like I sat when I had those conversations with the students, surprised me the ideas that they had, and I wanted others to experience this wonderful world.
And I think the key to open that door is a huge communication.
We need a vast communication of our scientists and engineers in order to change the world.
Our scientists and engineers are the ones who are attacking our biggest challenges from the environment and health care from health, and if we don't know we don't know about this, the work is not done, and I think it's our responsibility as we don't scientists have these interactions.
But these big conversations cannot happen if our scientists and engineers are not invited to see their wonderful world.
So scientists and engineers, please ask me with <unk>
I want to share some suggestions on how you can do it to make sure that his science is sexy and his engineering is attractive.
First question to <unk> and then what?
<unk> why science is relevant to us.
Don't tell us just that you study the <unk> but study the <unk> that are the mesh structure of our bones because it's important to understand and treat <unk>
And when you're describing your science, careful about <unk>
<unk> is an obstacle to our understanding of your ideas.
Sure, you can say <unk> and <unk> but why not say <unk> and <unk> which is much more accessible to us?
<unk> accessible is not the same thing as <unk>
On the contrary, as Einstein, said everything as simple as possible, but not simple.
They can communicate clearly their science without engaging ideas.
Something to consider is to use examples, stories and analogies -- these are ways of hooking and <unk> with its content.
And when I present her work, forget about the signs of <unk>
You have wondered why they're called <unk>  What do you do? They get the bullets -- the bullets -- they kill their presentation.
A <unk> like this is not just boring, but it's driven too much in the language of our brain and <unk>
Instead, this <unk> example of <unk> Brown is much more effective -- it shows that the special structure of <unk> is so strong that it really inspired the unique design of the Eiffel Tower, <unk>
The trick here is to use a simple machine, <unk> that the public can understand whether you lose a little bit, and then give you graphs that reward our other senses and create a deeper sense of understanding what it was about.
And I think these are just some key ones that can help the other open open door and look at the country of wonders that is science and engineering.
And so, scientists and engineers, when they've solved this equation, by all media, <unk> with <unk>  Thank you.
One of my favorite words from all the Oxford English <unk> is <unk>
Just because it sounds very well.
And <unk> means <unk> <unk>
Although there was an editor coming from the 19th century that defined the very much better defined when he said, "A <unk> is that you search for a public charge no matter -- or no matter -- which is a platform -- and when he <unk> it for the mere use of a monumental <unk>
I have no idea what <unk> means.
Something to do with the words, I guess.
It's very important that words are the foundation in politics, and that all politicians know that they have to do <unk> the language.
It was not <unk> for example, <unk> that British Parliament allowed newspapers to quote the exact words they were saying in the camera <unk>
And all of this was because of a guy with the rare name of <unk> <unk> who confronted the <unk>
He thrown in the Tower of London and <unk> him, but he had enough courage to deal with them, and at the end he had such a popular support in London that I won.
And only a few years later, we had the first recorded use of the phrase <unk> <unk> <unk> like the <unk>
Most people think it's true.
It's not. It's for a free advocate of expression.
But to show you really how words and politics interact, I want you to go back to the U.S., just after independence.
So, they had to address the question of how to call George Washington, his leader.
You didn't know.
How you call the leader of a <unk> country.
This is <unk> in Congress for a long time.
They were introduced all kinds of suggestions that might be <unk>
Some wanted to call it <unk> of State State and others, "Your <unk> George <unk> and other <unk> of the <unk> of the United States <unk>
Not very <unk>
Some of them just wanted to call it <unk>
They thought it was proven quality.
And they were not even <unk> they had the idea that you could be elected King for a given term.
And I could have <unk>
Everybody got tired <unk> because this debate was <unk> for three weeks.
I read the newspaper of a poor <unk> and I always <unk> it with this <unk>
What caused the <unk> and the <unk> was the House of <unk>
The House of <unk> I didn't want to be Washington <unk>
They didn't want to call it King for whether he did it or his commitment to ideas.
So, they wanted to give the title of the most <unk> <unk> <unk> that came up with.
And that title was <unk>
President. It didn't invent the title. There was before, but only meant <unk> that <unk> a <unk>
It was like the president of a jury.
And I had no more <unk> than the term <unk> or <unk>
There were chairs and <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> and <unk> but it was really a insignificant.
And so the Senate is <unk>
They said, "is ridiculous, we can't call it <unk>
"This guy has to sign treated and meet with <unk> <unk>
"And who will take you seriously with a <unk> <unk> <unk>
And finally, after three weeks of debate, the Senate is not <unk>
We can learn three interesting things about this.
First of all, and this is my favorite one to where I've been able to figure out the Senate has never been <unk> as the title of President.
President Barack Obama is lucky to keep in there, waiting for the Senate between action.
The second thing we can learn is that when a government says a measure is <unk>  <unk> possible to keep waiting for <unk> years.
But the third thing we can learn, and this is the most important, and this is what I want to tell you is that the U.S. title of the United States doesn't sound as modest today, right?
Especially if you have more than 5,000 nuclear heads and the world's largest economy and a fleet of electric vehicles and so on.
Reality and history have endowed with the title of <unk>
So at the end, I won the <unk>
Did you get his title of <unk>
And also the other concern of the Senate, appearance -- well, it was an <unk> then.
But you know how many nations have now <unk>
And all because they want to sound like the guy who has the 5,000 nuclear heads and so on.
So at the end the Senate won and the House of <unk> because no one is going to feel humble when you tell them that they're now the President of <unk>
And I think that's the great lesson we can learn, and what I'd like to give you to.
The politicians are trying to choose and use the words to shape and control reality, but really, really changes the words much more than the words that these might change reality.
Thank you very much.
I'm 45 at feet under the land in a illegal mine.
The air is loaded with heat and dust and it's hard to breathe.
I feel the touch of <unk> bodies in the dark, but I can't see much more.
I hear that you talk about it, but most of all, that cacophony of male <unk> and <unk> with tools.
Like others, I take a cheap flashlight of light, she supports the head with this <unk> <unk> and I can barely distinguish the branches of branches that hold the walls of that hole in that hole that drops hundreds of feet on Earth.
It was <unk> my hand and suddenly remember a <unk> that I met days before, who lost control and dropped feet into that well.
As I talk to you today, these guys are deep in the deep part of that hole in your life without paying any reward, and often, dying.
I went out of that hole and I went home, but they probably never will.
In the last 28 years I was documenting native cultures in more than 70 countries in six continents, and in 2009, I had the great honor of being the only <unk> in the Peace Peace <unk>
Among all the amazing people that I met there was a <unk> <unk> the <unk> a NGO which is dedicated to eradicate modern slavery.
We started talking about slavery and, really, I started learning about slavery because I knew that there was the world but not about grade.
When we finished talking, I felt very sad, I honestly was trying to ignore this <unk> of our days and I thought, if I don't know, how many people don't know?
He became <unk> the stomach and weeks later, I flew to Los Angeles to meet the director of <unk> the <unk> and offer my help.
So my journey to modern slavery.
Interestingly, I had been in many of these places.
A even thought about my second home.
But this time, <unk> the dirty <unk>
A conservative calculation says that there are more than 27 million people in the world in the world.
It's twice as much of African African numbers during the whole tries of slave trade.
150 years ago, the cost of a slave slave was about three times the annual salary of a U.S. worker.
The equivalent of about 50,000 people today.
However, you can take entire families out for <unk> for <unk> <unk>
Amazingly, slavery generates revenues from over <unk> billion dollars a year around the world.
Many of them have been <unk> with false promises of good education and better work to find out that they're forced to work without pay, under threat and can't escape.
Today slavery operates in <unk> the goods produced for slaves have value, but those who produce them are.
<unk> exists in almost everybody else, and yet it's illegal around the world.
In India and Nepal, I met the brick <unk>
This weird show and formidable show was like entering ancient Egypt or the <unk> of <unk>
<unk> at a temperature of 54 degrees Celsius -- men, women -- in fact, <unk> families <unk> in a <unk> cloak of <unk> mechanically bricks in their head, until 18 at the time, and the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> trucks that are at hundreds of feet.
<unk> for <unk> and <unk> work in silence, doing this task over and over again for 16 or 17 hours a day.
There were no pause to eat, not to drink, and the severe <unk> I would make it just rather <unk>
So <unk> were the heat and the dust that my camera was <unk> and it was too hot and I stopped working.
Every 20 minutes I had to run into the car to clean the team and make it work with air conditioning to <unk> and, sitting there, I was thinking, my camera gets a much better treatment for these people.
So back in the furnaces I wanted to cry but the <unk> I was on my side and he said, "You don't do it. Don't do it here."
And he explained to me so clearly that demonstrate emotions is very dangerous in places like this, not only for me but for them.
I couldn't give you any direct aid.
I couldn't give them money, anything.
I was not citizens of that country.
I could put them in a worse situation than they were.
I had to trust the <unk> the <unk> and work inside the system for her liberation and he trusted him to <unk>
As soon as I waited home to feel my heart <unk>
In the Himalayas I found children dragging <unk> for miles through <unk> land until trucks were waiting down.
Those big <unk> were heavy than the children that the load and the kids would put them on their heads with straps <unk> made out of them, ropes and <unk>
It's hard to witness something so <unk>
How can we influence something so <unk> but so <unk>
Some people don't even know that they're slaves -- and they work 16 or 17 hours a day without <unk> because this has been the whole life.
You don't have anything to <unk>
When these villagers <unk> her freedom, <unk> them completely <unk>
When we hear the word slavery we often think of sexual trafficking, and because of this global conscience advised me that it would be difficult for me to work safely in this particular business.
In <unk> I was <unk> women who had been previously previously <unk>
It led me on the stairs <unk> that gave me this dirty basement of <unk> a florescent light.
It wasn't exactly a <unk>
It was a restaurant.
<unk> as it is known for the craft, they are local for prostitution <unk>
They have small rooms -- private rooms where they <unk> them with their girls and children, some of this seven years -- are forced to entertain clients and <unk> to buy more food and alcohol.
Each of them is dark and <unk> identified by a series of painted on the wall and divided by a curtain.
The workers often suffer with sexual abuse of their clients.
From <unk> I remember a sense of <unk> <unk> fear -- and in that instant, I could barely imagine what should be stuck in that hell.
I just had a <unk> on the stairs so that we were going to come up.
There was no <unk>
There was no windows enough for <unk>
Those people don't have <unk> and, because you touch a topic so difficult -- it's important to point out that slavery even even sexual trafficking, happens around us.
There are hundreds of people standing in agriculture, in restaurants, in the home service, and the list can continue.
Recently, the New York Times reported that among 100,000 Americans and 300,000 Americans are sold every year as sex slave lives.
It's everywhere, but we don't see it.
<unk> are another activity that often compared to the labor of <unk>
I went to experimental villages in which there were entire families <unk> in the trade of silk.
This is a family family.
The <unk> hands of black are the parent, the <unk> of blue and red, of their children.
<unk> <unk> in these big drums and <unk> silk in the liquid to <unk> but <unk> is <unk>
My translator told me their stories.
We have no <unk> they said.
We still hope, though, can be out of this house someday and go to another place where we really pay our job."
It's estimated that there are more than 4,000 children in Lake <unk> the biggest artificial lake in the world.
When we arrived, I went to take a quick look at it.
And I saw what seemed to be a family of fishermen on a boat, two brothers -- some younger brothers -- some younger children makes sense, right?
<unk> They were all <unk>
The kids are separated from their <unk> families, missing and forced to work with a long time on these boats in the lake, despite not knowing swimming.
This boy has eight years old.
When our boat came up to me was <unk> I mean her little canoe <unk>
I was paralyzed by the fear of falling into water.
<unk> branches of trees plunged into Lake <unk> often catch networks and children, <unk> and fear, it sticks to the water to unlock the branches.
Many of them are <unk>
Since remember, it's always been forced to work in the lake.
Because the fear of his self is not going to flee and, like all of life has been treated with <unk> <unk> it is the younger slaves under their command.
I met these guys at five o'clock in the morning, when they were getting up the last networks, but they had been working on the last one.
In the cold night and <unk>
And it will point out that these networks weigh over 400 kilos when they're packed with fish.
I want to introduce you to <unk>
Kofi was rescued in a village of fishermen.
I met it in a refuge where the <unk> <unk> the victims of slavery.
Kofi symbolizes as possible.
Who got to be because someone decided to make a difference in your life?
<unk> on a road in Ghana with <unk> the <unk> a fellow <unk> with their Olu suddenly sped up and <unk> our car and a window.
It asked us to take it through a road path to the jungle.
At the end of the way, we got to go out of the car, and he asked the driver that was going to come out very quickly.
Then he pointed out this path just visible and said, "This is the path, this is the road.
As we started to <unk> we took the <unk> that we took on the path and after walking around close to an hour we found that the path was <unk> by the recent <unk> so I put the photos of photos on my head as you go to the chest.
After two hours of <unk> the road ended up <unk> in one of course, and we had a mass of holes that could fit into a soccer field, and everybody was full of <unk> workers.
Many women had children tied their back, and as they were looking for gold, <unk> in the waters and <unk>
<unk> is used in the process of <unk>
These <unk> are embedded in a well in another part of Ghana.
When they came out of the pit they were <unk> in their own <unk>
I remember watching his eyes tired, <unk> given that many had been under land for 72 hours.
<unk> have to be 90 feet and these people carry up heavy stone bags that will then be transported to another area where they get the rock to be able to extract the gold.
To the first sight, the site seems to be filled with strong men and <unk> but if we look closer, the margin we see to work at least lucky and also children.
They're all victims of injuries, and violence.
In fact, it's very likely that this <unk> ends up like this victim of tuberculosis and the <unk> of <unk> in a few years.
This is <unk> When his father died he took him to work with him in the mines.
When you die in your uncle, I think, "I inherit the debt of the uncle what force it to be a slave in the mines.
When I met him, he had been working on the mines 14 and the leg injury you see here is a product of a crash in the <unk> so serious that the doctors were saying it should be <unk>
In addition to that, <unk> has T.B. and, yet, to that, he's forced to work on night and day on that mine.
And yet, he dreams to be liberated and educated with local activists like <unk> the <unk> and it's this kind of determination, the face of a remote, which inspires me a lot of respect.
I want to shine light on slavery.
Did you know that your images would be seen by you all over the world.
I wanted you to know that we will give them testimony to them and we're going to do everything possible to help change their lives.
<unk> I think if we see each other as human beings, then it makes it difficult to tolerate atrocities like slavery.
These images are not journals of people, real people, like you and I, who deserve the same rights, dignity and respect in their lives.
There's no day that I think I don't think of these so many beautiful people that I have had the great honor to meet.
I hope that these images show a force in which you see them in people like you, and I hope that the force will turn into a fire and that fire <unk> light over slavery because, without that light, the beast of slavery can continue to live in the shadows.
Thank you very much.
I do a particular math problem, and there's a particular problem for the <unk> we are like management,
Nobody knows what the heck we do.
So today I will try to explain to you what I do.
The dance is one of the most human activities.
We were telling us the <unk> of the ballet <unk> and the dancers of <unk>  we're going to see later on.
But <unk> demands a degree of extraordinary training -- a high level of dexterity -- a high level of skill, and probably a certain initial <unk> that can well have a genetic component.
Sadly, neurological disorders like Parkinson's disease, destroy this extraordinary ability, as it does with my friend <unk> <unk> who, at the time, was a virtuous ballet ballet ballet ballet ballet ballet ballet ballet ballet ballet ballet ballet ballet ballet ballet ballet ballet ballet ballet ballet ballet ballet ballet ballet ballet ballet ballet ballet ballet ballet ballet ballet ballet ballet ballet ballet ballet ballet ballet ballet ballet ballet ballet ballet ballet
In the last few years has been made a lot of progress on treatment.
However, there are <unk> million people in the world who are sick, and have to deal with a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and other symptoms of this disease, so we need <unk> tools to detect disease before it's too late.
We need to be able to measure progress in an objective way and ultimately the only way we know if there is really a cure to be when we have an objective measure and <unk>
But it's frustrating that for Parkinson's and other disorders of the movement there is no biological markers -- so they don't serve the blood analysis and the best we have is a neurological test.
You have to go to a clinic to do it. It's very, very expensive, and that means that, outside the clinical trials, they never will.
And what if patients could do it at home?
That would save a trip to the clinic. What if patients could do the exam <unk>
You wouldn't need personal.
By the way, it costs about 300 dollars in the clinic <unk>
So what I want to propose to you as a conventional form of conventional <unk> you see, in some sense at least, we're all <unk> as my friend <unk> <unk>
This is a video of the vibration of vocal ropes.
It shows someone right while it emits sounds at the talk, and we can imagine as a dancers of a <unk> <unk> because we have to coordinate all those vocal organs to produce sounds and we all have the <unk>
And as they did it requires an extraordinary training level.
Let's think about the time that takes a child to learn to speak.
From the sound, we can track the position of vocal cords as <unk> and so like Parkinson's affects the limbs, also affect the spinal organs.
In the bottom plot you can see an example of the jagged shake of vocal ropes.
We see the same <unk>
shake a <unk> <unk> weakness and <unk>
The speech gets more quiet and <unk> after a while, and this is an example of the symptoms.
How do you compare these tests, based on the voice with <unk> clinical trials -- well, both of them are not <unk>
The neurological test, not <unk> both use existing infrastructure.
You don't need to design a whole series of hospitals to make them.
Both of them are <unk> OK, but in addition to the exams.
I mean, they can be <unk>
They're very quickly, it takes about 30 seconds as a lot.
They're the minimum cost, and we all know what happens.
When something takes a cost of cost.
These are some incredible goals.
We can reduce the difficulties from the patients.
I don't need to go to the clinic for the follow-up <unk>
With high-frequency tracking, we could get objective data.
We could make mass <unk> for clinical trials, for the first time, <unk> <unk> on scale.
We have the opportunity to start looking for the first <unk> of the disease before it's too late.
So when I give you the first steps in that sense, we're launching the <unk> <unk>
Together with <unk> and <unk> we want to record a lot of voices around the world to collect enough data and start to address these goals.
We have accessible local lines for about 750 million people in the world.
<unk> with or <unk> it can call low price and leave recordings for a few cents. And I'm pleased to announce that we've already reached six percent of the goal in only eight hours.
Thank you.   Tom Rielly: So I want to take all of these samples of, let's say 10,000 people, you'll be able to say who's healthy and who isn't it?
What will you take from these <unk>
Max <unk> Yeah, yeah. What happens is that during the call you have to indicate whether or not the disease.
<unk> You can see, some people can not <unk> it may not be <unk>
But we're going to get a very big sample of data in different circumstances, and to do it in different circumstances, it's important because we're looking for <unk> the obesity factors looking for the actual markers of disease.
TR: Do you have a <unk> <unk> at this moment?
<unk> Much more than that.
Actually, my student <unk> I have to have a fantastic job, and now has shown that it works a fantastic job, and now has shown that it works on the mobile phone network as well, what we did the project, we have 99 percent accurately.
TR: <unk> and nine. Well, it's a improvement.
<unk> Absolutely.
TR: Thank you very much. Max <unk>
<unk> Thank you, <unk>
Before March of 2011, I was doing <unk> <unk> in New York City.
We are <unk> creatures.
We were focusing on the dark, in rooms without windows and usually, we avoid sunlight.
We do the thin models still more <unk> the perfect perfect skin -- we do the impossible, and we get into the press all the time, but some of us are really artists with talent with many years of experience and a real taste for images and photography.
On March 11, 2011, I saw from my house, just like the rest of the world, the <unk> events that were happening in Japan.
Shortly later, an organization where I was <unk> where <unk> <unk> was in the place working as part of the response team.
I, along with hundreds of other volunteers we knew that we couldn't stay sitting home, so I decided to join the group for three weeks.
The 13 of May I traveled to <unk>
It's a little fishermen of fishermen located in the <unk> of <unk> of almost 50,000 people, one of the first people affected by the wave.
The level of water recorded took over 24 feet tall and over three miles land in.
As you can imagine, the people was <unk>
We take rubble from channels and <unk>
<unk> schools, removed the mud and we dropped the houses ready to be <unk> and <unk>
We took tons and tons of dead fish and tons of dead fish from the local factory.
We love us, and we loved it.
For weeks, both of the volunteers as the neighbors were similar things.
They found pictures and <unk> pictures and cameras and cards.
They all did the same thing.
<unk> and take them to different places of villages around the <unk>
It wasn't until I realized that those pictures represented a huge part of the personal losses that people had <unk>
As they were fleeing the <unk> and to save their lives, they had to abandon absolutely everything they had.
At the end of my first week I started to help in a <unk> center of the people.
It helped clean up <unk> giant toilets, gigantic <unk>
This place turned out to be the place of the village where the <unk> center was <unk>
And so I took them and I had the honor that that day would be <unk> in me to clean up the photos.
And this was exciting and inspiring, I had heard the expression of thinking beyond <unk> but it wasn't until I went through my horizons that something happened.
When you look at the pictures, I found a few who had over a hundred years -- some of them were still in the lab, I couldn't help but think about how <unk> how to fix that <unk> and repair that <unk> and I knew hundreds of people who could do the same thing.
So that night I walked into Facebook contacted some of them, and the next morning, the answer was so overwhelming and positive and I knew we had to try.
So we started <unk> the photos.
This was the first of all.
It wasn't too <unk> but where the water had <unk> the face of the girl to get to <unk> with a lot of precision and <unk>
Otherwise that little girl would not have the aspect of it, and that would be so tragic as having the photo <unk>
Over time, over time, they got a lot more photos and they needed more <unk> so it went back to Facebook and <unk> and five days later 80 people in 12 countries volunteered to help.
Within two weeks I had 150 people from <unk>
In Japan, in July, we were <unk> to <unk> a local village north of <unk>
Once in the week we use our scanner in the temporary <unk> and time libraries were <unk> where people were going to reclaim their photos.
The time that we <unk> in <unk> is a different story, depended on of course the <unk> of the photos.
It could make an hour. I could make weeks <unk>
I could make months <unk>
This <unk> had to draw pretty much by hand using the areas whose color and detail the water had no <unk>
I took a lot of time.
The water destroyed all these pictures that are <unk> in water covered with bacteria, with seaweed, all of it along with the time of the time, I continue to <unk> it was an important part of the project.
We couldn't afford the picture unless it was clean <unk> and it would have been <unk> by his <unk>
We had <unk> <unk>
We tell the guide of a <unk>
It's very easy to harm even more the photos already <unk>
As once he said, the leader of my group is like making a tattoo.
You can't make mistakes.
The woman who brought us these pictures were lucky to the photos.
I had started <unk> she itself but stopped when they realized it even more.
I also had <unk>
Without them, the images of her husband and his own face would not have been <unk> we were able to <unk> the images in a single picture, and it took the full picture.
When I picked up their pictures shared something from her history with us.
A few colleagues of her husband found the photos on a fire station between the ground far from where she used to be his house, but his colleagues would sell it.
The day of the tsunami, her husband was the experimenter to close the barriers to the wave.
He had to go inside the water as the <unk> <unk>
Their young children, not so small now, but their two children were at school, in different schools.
One of them was trapped in the water.
He took him a week to find his whole family and know that everybody had survived.
The day I gave him his pictures his son was under 14 years old.
For her, even though all of this, these pictures were the best gift that he could tell you something that he could remember from the past that had not been marked by the past day of March when everything in his life changed or was <unk>
After six months in Japan 1,100 volunteers had joined there, <unk> hundreds of them helped us clean up with more than <unk> <unk> photographs -- the big majority -- the vast majority came back of their <unk>
More than 500 volunteers around the world helped us bring back to 90 families hundreds and completely <unk> and <unk>
During this time, we actually don't spend more than 1,000 into teams and materials, most of them in ink for <unk>
We take pictures all the time.
One picture is a memory of someone or something, one place, a loved person.
They are <unk> of our memories and stories, the last thing we would take to look for us -- but the first thing we want to look for.
This was the project, of restore small pieces of humanity, to bring someone their connection to the past.
When a picture like this comes back to somebody, it's a huge difference in the life of the person who gets in.
This project also made a huge difference in the life of <unk>
Some of them connected them with something bigger -- I'll give something bigger -- using their talent to something that they're not very thin skin models.
To end I'd like to read this email -- I sent him Cindy the day I came back from Japan after six months.
As I <unk> I couldn't stop thinking about people and the stories shown in the images.
One in particular, a picture with women of different ages from the grandmother to the small girl, <unk> around a baby, <unk> <unk> because a similar picture of my family my grandmother, my mother, and my <unk> daughter hangs out of our wall.
In the whole world, in the whole world, all of our basic needs, right?
Thank you.  <unk>
<unk> <unk> inspired us and curiosity with this picture of a bullet that goes through an apple in an exhibition of just a millionth of a second.
But now, 50 years later, we can go a million times faster and see the world not a million or a billion frames per second.
I present to you a new kind of <unk> <unk> a new technique that can create videos in the slow motion of light into motion.
And with that we can create chambers that can look after the <unk> beyond the line of vision, or see the inside of the body without using X-rays, and you really challenge the camera idea.
If I take a laser pointer and I switch on it and it goes into a <unk> of second or a number of <unk> to create a collection of photons from just a millimeter millimeter <unk>
And that package of photons, -- that <unk> traveling at the speed of light, and again, a million times faster than a common bullet as a common bullet as a common bullet as well.
If we take that bullet and this package of photons and <unk> in this bottle, how they disperse those photons into this <unk>
What is the light aspect of light in <unk>
Now, all of this --   Remember, all of this is actually happening in less than a <unk> is what it takes to travel in.
But this video is 10 billion times slower so you can see light in motion.
Coca-Cola is not <unk> this research --   -- so many things in this <unk> <unk> this information to show what's going on.
The pulse, our <unk> comes into the bottle with a package of photons that starts <unk> and that inside, it starts to <unk>
Part of the light is <unk> it goes to the table, and we started seeing these <unk>
Many of the photons finally come to the lid and then explode in various directions.
As you can see, there's a air bubble that bounces inside the inside.
And in that time, the waves travel on the table and because of the insights from the top it looks at the bottom of the bottle, after several boxes, that the ones were <unk>
Now, if we take a common bullet and current bullet and we see it the same distance and we see it in slow down about 10 billion times, how much you think it would take us to sit down to see that film?
A day? A week? Actually, a whole year.
It would be a very boring film, with a slow slow <unk>
And what about how do we test nature <unk>
You can see the waves coming down from the table, from the outside of the background.
It's like throwing a stone on a pond.
It's the way nature paints a picture, I thought of a <unk> at the time, but of course, our eyes see a full composition of it.
But if you look at a more and more this tomato, you'll realize that, as the light comes <unk> of tomato sauce, is still bright. They don't <unk>
Why? Because the tomato is <unk> and light bounces inside it and it goes back to a number of <unk> of a second.
In the future, when this <unk> is in your mobile phone, they're going to be able to go to the supermarket and verify if the fruit is grown without having to touch it.
Why do we create this camera in the <unk>
As photographers -- you know, if we take a picture at the low exposure, it enters very little light.
But we're going to go to a billion times faster than the shortest age, so you just go into some light.
We sent that back to that package that package of photons, billion times, and we recorded over and over again with a very <unk> <unk> we took those data <unk> and the <unk> <unk> to create those <unk> that I showed you.
We can take all of those data in raw and <unk> in an interesting way.
Superman can fly.
Other heroes can become invisible, too.
And if a new power of a traumatic future would allow him to see after the <unk>
The idea is that we could throw a little bit of light on the door. You will go into the room, one part is going to reflect in the door, and from there to the camera.
Where we could get those multiple <unk> of light.
It's not science fiction -- we've been built.
On the left, is our <unk>
Behind the wall is a dummy and you get the light on the door.
After the publication of our article in <unk> <unk>
And a small fraction of the photons will return to the camera but interestingly, in a slightly different time.
And as we have a camera that works so quickly, our <unk> has unique capability.
It has very good resolution and you can look at the world at the speed of light.
So we know the distance to the door and also to the hidden objects -- but we don't know what it corresponds to what it corresponds to what it corresponds to it.
By projecting a laser you can record a <unk> picture, you see on the screen, it really doesn't make any sense.
But we will take a lot of images like this, tens of images, we're going to join them and we will try to analyze the multiple <unk> of light, and with that, we can see the object <unk>
Can we look at it <unk>
This is our reconstruction to us.
We have things to explore before we get this out of the lab, but in the future, we could create cars that <unk> collisions with what's going on the curve, it's going to be <unk>
Or we could look at survivors in dangerous conditions, looking at the light reflected by the open windows of the open.
Or we could build <unk> capable of looking at the inside of the body <unk> <unk> and the same for <unk>
But of course, because of tissue and blood that is quite hard, so this is actually a request to scientists to start thinking about <unk> as a new visualization sector to solve the problems of medical imaging for the next generation.
And as well as Doc <unk> he was a scientist, it became science in art, an art of photographs.
And I realized that all the <unk> of data we collect every time are not just for scientific visualization, but we can can have it.
We create a new form of computational photography with slow camera and color codes.
And look at those waves. Remember, the time between each of those waves is just a few <unk> of a second.
But this is also something fun.
If you look at the waves below the <unk> these are leaving us from us.
The waves should move towards us.
What happens here?
It turns out, as we're recording almost at the speed of light, we have strange effects -- Einstein would have liked to see this image.
The order where events happen in the world sometimes appears to be invested in the camera.
It will be <unk> the corresponding of space of space and time, we can correct this <unk>
It's time. Thank you.
Hi. This is my mobile phone.
A mobile phone can change life, and it gives you individual freedom.
With a mobile phone can <unk> a crime against humanity in Syria.
You can tweet a message and start a protest in Egypt.
With a mobile phone you can record a song, and that would be able to make it famous.
This is all possible with a mobile phone.
I'm a <unk> of 1984 and alive in the city of <unk>
Let's go back to that moment, this town.
Here you can see how many hundreds of thousands of people were going to look for change.
This is the fall of 1989. You can imagine if all of these people who are <unk> that they were looking for a change, had a cell phone in your pocket.
Who are a mobile phone here?
<unk>
Raise your mobile phones, <unk>
<unk> A Android, a wow!
It's a lot. Almost everybody today has a mobile.
But today I'm talking about my mobile phone, and how it changed my life.
I'm going to talk about this.
These are 35 <unk> of information.
Data <unk>
Why is that data there?
Because in the summer of 2006, the Commission for the E.U. introduced a <unk>
<unk> <unk> of <unk>
This lady says that every single European company, every single Internet provider has to store a broad range of information from the users.
Who calls <unk> who sends an email to who.
Who sends a text to who.
And if we use the mobile phone, where are we in.
All of this information is stored by at least six months, and until two years, in his phone company, or your Internet provider or your Internet.
And across Europe people stood up and said, "We don't want this."
They said they didn't want this data <unk>
We want the <unk> in the digital age, and we don't want the phone phone and the Internet providers -- all this information about us.
There was lawyers, journalists, they all said, "We don't want this."
And here you can see about 10,000 people who came out to the streets of Berlin and they said, <unk> not <unk>
And some even said this would be <unk> 2.0.
The <unk> was the secret police of East Germany.
And I also wondered if this really works.
Can you store all this information about us?
Every time I use your <unk>
So I asked my phone <unk> <unk> <unk> who at that time was the largest telephone company in Germany, that I would please get rid of all the information they had on me.
I asked them once, and I went back to me, and I didn't have a concrete answer. It was all right.
But then I said, I want to have this information, because you are <unk> my life.
So I decided to take a judicial demand because I wanted to have this information.
But <unk> <unk> said no, we will not give you this information.
At the end of that, you know, a agreement.
They would give me the demand and they send me the information that I <unk>
Meanwhile, the <unk> <unk> failed the <unk> for the German law of the E.U.
So I got this ugly part of brown with a CD inside.
And in the CD there was this.
Thirty thousand <unk> 30 lines of information.
And I looked at it, and I said, well, it's a huge archive. Okay.
But after a while I realized that it's my life.
There are six months of my life in this archive.
It was a little bit <unk> what should we do with that?
Because you can see where I am, where I step night, what I'm doing.
But then I said, I want this <unk> information.
I want to make it <unk>
Because I want to show people what the data retention means.
So next to <unk> <unk> and open came back City, we did this.
This is a visualization of six months of my life.
You can zoom in and get out, go back and go forward.
You can see every step I do.
And you can see how I'm going to <unk> on train to <unk> and how often I call it the way.
This is all possible with this information.
That gives a little scary.
But it's not just me.
It's about all of us.
First of all, there are things like, I call my wife and she calls me to talk a couple of times.
And then they call me some friends and they call it between them.
And then you call the other, and then we end up with this big network of communication.
You can see how people communicate to each other, what time they call each other, what time to sleep.
You can see this stuff.
You can see the centers, the leaders of the group.
If you have access to this information, you can see what the society is.
If you have access to this information, you can control your society.
This is a model for countries like China and Iran.
This is a model to study the shape of your society, because you know who talks to whom, who sends an email to who, all of this is possible if you have access to this information.
And this information is stored at least six months in Europe, and to two years.
As I said at the beginning, imagine if all of these people on the streets of Berlin, in the fall of 1989, they had a mobile phone in your pocket.
And the <unk> had known who I was involved in this protest and if <unk> had known who the leaders, this would never have happened.
The fall of the Berlin Wall might never have happened.
And as a result, neither is the fall of <unk>
Because today the state agencies and companies want to store so much information from us as possible inside and outside the web.
They want to have the possibility to follow our lives and they want to run it forever.
But <unk> and living in the digital age is not a contradiction.
But today you have to fight for <unk>
You have to fight for that every day.
When you go home to your friends that privacy is a value of the 21st century and not just fashion.
When you go home, you get your representative that only because business agencies and state agencies can store some information, they don't have to do it.
And if you don't believe me, ask your phone company, what information store from you.
So in the future, every time you use your mobile phones that are given to you to remember that they have to fight for the <unk> in the digital age.
Thank you.
Hi TEDWomen, what happens?
It's not enough.
Hi TEDWomen, what happens?
I call myself <unk> <unk> and I'm not <unk> but I know the doctor that brought me to the world.
<unk> to my mom six times in six different addresses in the process. Tell the poor of me in the process.
As a result, I have cerebral palsy, and that's why it was all the time.
<unk>
It's <unk> I'm like a mixture of <unk>
And Muhammad <unk>
The P. <unk> is not genetics.
It's not <unk> it can't be <unk>
No one would tell the uterus of my mother and not <unk> because my parents were cousins, although they are.
It's just about accidents, as the one that happened to birth.
Now, I'm going to tell you, I'm not a source of inspiration -- and I don't want any of us.
You feel bad for me, because at some point in life, you wish to be disabled at some time.
Let's go for <unk>
Christmas card <unk> are at the shopping center, driving in circles looking for parking lot and what do you see?
16 places in empty <unk>
And they think, "God, can I be at least a little bit <unk>
In addition, I tell you, I've got 99 problems, and by P. C. is just one of them.
There is a <unk> of <unk> I would win the gold medal.
I am Palestinian and Muslim woman, disabled and alive in New Jersey.
If you don't feel better, maybe they should do it.
I'm from Park <unk> in New Jersey.
I always loved my neighborhood and my disease had the same initial ones.
I also love that if I wanted to walk from my home to New York, it might.
A lot of people with cerebral palsy, but my parents don't believe the "Don't stop.
The mantra of my father was, "Can you <unk> <unk> <unk>
If my three sisters <unk> I <unk>
If my three sisters older people went to public school, my parents would return to the school system, my parents would send out to the school system, and if I didn't have all the ultimate note -- all the <unk> of my mother.
My father taught me to walk in the age of five years, putting my <unk> on his feet and just walking.
Another approach that I used to do was hang a dollar in front of me so that I did it.
The <unk> that I carry in was very strong and ...
Yeah. The first day in the kindergarten I was walking as a pole champion as a pole champion as many <unk>
Growing up, there were only six Arabs in my city and were all of the family.
Now there are 20 Arabic -- and they're still all of the family.  I think no one realized that we were not <unk>
This was before 9/11, and that politicians would think appropriate to use <unk> to <unk> like the campaign.
The people I grew up with no problem with my faith.
However, it seemed to be a lot of a lot that dies of starvation during the <unk>
I told them that I had enough fat fat to live three months without eating it, so <unk> from dawn to sunset is very easy.
<unk> <unk> in <unk>
Yeah, in <unk> It's crazy.  My parents couldn't afford physical therapy, so they sent me to the dance school.
I learned to dance with <unk> or whether I can walk with <unk>
I'm from New Jersey, and we want to be <unk> so if my friends used <unk> I do too.
And when my friends were going to spend the summer vacation on the coast of Jersey, I wasn't going.
I spent my summers in a war zone, because my parents worried that if we didn't go back to Palestine all of the <unk> we would get sick in <unk>
On summer holiday often my father was about <unk> so I was drinking milk on the back, so I was drinking cups on the back, I was stuck in the Mediterranean Sea, and I remember the water <unk> my eyes, and I was like, <unk> <unk>
But the <unk> cure was yoga.
I have to say it's very boring, but before I do yoga it was a comedian of <unk> that I couldn't stand up <unk> <unk>
And now I can focus on the head.
My parents would take this idea that I could do anything, that any dream was impossible, and my dream was to be at the <unk> Hospital in <unk> Hospital.
I went to college through the positive discrimination, and I got a scholarship for the University of Arizona, because he entered all the <unk>
It was like the <unk> of the theater.
Everyone <unk>
I did all the tasks of the least smart, I took the ultimate note in my school, and also in their classrooms.
Every time I was doing a scene from the glass lobby my professors <unk>
But I never got a role.
Finally, in my last year, the <unk> decided to make a work called <unk> very slow <unk>
It's a piece of a girl with cerebral palsy,
I was a girl with cerebral palsy,
So I started screaming at the four <unk> <unk> <unk>
I have paralysis <unk>
By the end of it. In order to get it out.
Thank God <unk> I am <unk>
I didn't get the role.  They gave it to <unk> Brown.
I went to <unk> running to the middle of the theater, crying on historically, as if someone had killed my cat, asking him why and she told me that because they believed it could not make the stunt stunt stunt stunt stunt stunt stunt stunt stunt stunt stunt stunt stunt stunt can.
And I said, <unk> if I can't do some risk, you can't do the <unk>
It was a role for which it literally was born and gave it to an actress without cerebral palsy,
I was imitating my life.
Hollywood has a <unk> history of <unk> actors without disability for <unk>
When I went back home, and my first tour, <unk> was as extra in a <unk>
My dream was made up.
And I knew it would be <unk> to <unk> friend <unk> in a <unk>
Instead, I stayed there as a <unk> I didn't see me more than the <unk> and it was obvious to me that the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> were not white, with disability.
They only encourage perfect people.
But there were exceptions to the rule.
I grew up watching <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and all these women had one thing in common: They were <unk>
That's why I made myself <unk>
On my first tour, I took <unk> from New York to New Jersey, and never forget the face of the first comedian that led when he went at the point that he went at high-speed head to the New Jersey head with a driver that had cerebral palsy,
I worked in clubs.
Some people say I'm the first <unk> of the Arab world.
I never like to reclaim the first place, but I know you never heard that little disgusting rumor that says that women are not fun, and they find very fun.
In 2003, my brother of another mother and father, Dean <unk> and I launched the <unk> <unk> New York Festival now in his 10 year.
Our goal was to change the negative image of the <unk> in media media and to remind you to <unk> directors that <unk> and Arabic are not <unk>
The Arabs were much easier to fight the challenge of the stigma of disability.
My great opportunity came in 2010.
I was invited to the news program by wire, it has Keith <unk>
I walked down as if I went to a dance dance, I would stop a studio and they sat in a wheelchair.
I looked at the director and I said, <unk> you can give me another <unk>
She looked at me and said, <unk> four, three, <unk>
And we were in <unk>
So I held on to the host desk in order to not go through the screen during the <unk> and when I finished the interview, I was <unk>
I had my opportunity and <unk> I knew they wouldn't want me.
But not only Mr. <unk> went back to <unk> but I was left as a full-time participant and pasted my chair.
Something kind of fun with Keith <unk> was that people on the Internet are <unk>
The children are <unk> but they never get older than older and no older girl.
Suddenly, my Internet disability became an object of <unk>
I scan clips <unk> with comments like, "Why do you <unk>
"It's <unk>
And my favorite <unk> <unk> terrorist.
What does the disease have?
We should really pray for her."
A <unk> suggested even that I would add my disability to my <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> is as visual as race.
If someone in a wheelchair can't do <unk> then <unk> can't make someone in <unk>
<unk> are the -- yeah, <unk> <unk>
<unk> are the world's largest minority in the world, and the most <unk> in the world of entertainment.
The doctors said not to myself, but I'm here in front of you.
However, I grew up with the media, I don't think I <unk>
I hope that together we can create most positive images of disability in media and everyday life.
Maybe if there were more positive images, that will be less hate on the Internet.
Or maybe not.
Maybe we still need a whole society to teach our children.
My tortuous journey has led me to very spectacular places.
I arrived at <unk> by the red carpet <unk> Susan <unk> and the famous <unk> <unk>
I got to act in a film with Adam <unk> and working with my <unk> the incredible Dave <unk>
<unk> the Arab world, "The Arabs have become <unk>
I was <unk> in a depiction of the great state of New Jersey in the <unk> of 2008.
And I founded "The <unk> of <unk> a charity to give the Syrian refugee children, a tiniest part of what my parents would tell me.
It was the only time my father saw me live alive, and I do this talk to his memory.
<unk> <unk> <unk>
I call myself <unk> <unk> and if I can, you can too.
I'd like to tell you a story about a kid from a young town.
I don't know his name, but I know their story.
He lives in a little town to the South <unk>
This village is near <unk>
<unk> drives the little village to poverty and the edge of the <unk>
There's nothing for him there, it's going to the big city, in this case, <unk> the capital of Somalia.
When it comes there, there is no job, there is no job, no longer <unk>
He's just living in a tent in the city outside of <unk>
After maybe a year <unk> nothing.
One day he gets a guy who gives him to take it back to <unk> after dinner to <unk>
It makes a dynamic group of people, which gives you a break.
He gets a little bit of money to buy new clothes, money to send home to your family.
They present to a young lady.
They finally go home.
It starts a new life.
It has a goal of life.
A beautiful day in <unk> under a blue sky bursts a car bomb.
That boy of that little boy with dreams of the great city was the <unk> terrorist and that dynamic group of people were the <unk> a connected terrorist organization with the Qaeda.
So how does the story of a little boy in a little town trying to fulfill their dreams in the city ends with him <unk>
He was waiting for.
I was waiting for an opportunity, waiting to start her future, waiting for a future perspective, and this was the first thing they arrived.
This was the first thing that pulled it out of what we call "the length of <unk>
And their story is repeated in urban centers around the world.
It's the story of the <unk> young urban <unk> that <unk> riots in <unk> <unk> riots in London, looking for something beyond the <unk> of <unk>
For the young, the promise of the city, the great dream of city is the opportunity for well-being, for well-being, but young people are not involved in the prosperity of their cities.
It's often the youth who suffer from the highest rates.
By 2030, three of five people living in cities are being under 18 years.
If we don't include young people in the growth of our cities, if they don't give them opportunities -- the history of <unk> <unk> the door of access to terrorism, and to the <unk> to be the history of cities 2.0.
And in my hometown of birth, <unk> 70 percent of the young people is <unk>
70 doesn't work, it's not going to school.
They do almost nothing.
I went back to <unk> last month, and I went to visit the hospital Hospital in the hospital where I was born.
I remember standing in front of that hospital <unk> thinking, and if I had never gone?
And if I had seen me forced to be in that same <unk> of <unk>
I would have become <unk>
I'm not really sure the answer.
The reason I was in <unk> that month was actually to harbor a few youth leaders at a business profession.
We went to about 90 youth leaders.
We sat down and we had a <unk> of ideas about solutions to the big challenges facing the city.
One of the young people in the room was <unk>
He was at the University of <unk> <unk>
I had no job, no opportunity.
I remember when he told me that because he was a graduate student, unemployed, frustrated, was the perfect white for Al <unk> and other organizations in the order to be <unk>
They were looking for people like it.
But this story takes a different path.
In <unk> the biggest hurdle to get from point A to B are the streets.
<unk> years of civil war have destroyed completely the traffic system, and a motorcycle can be the easiest way of <unk>
<unk> saw an opportunity and <unk>
He started a <unk> company.
He started <unk> motorcycles of local residents who were usually couldn't afford to.
I bought 10 <unk> with the help of her family and friends, and his dream is at some time to expand hundreds of motorcycles over the next three years.
Why is it different this story?
What does this different?
I think its ability to identify and leverage a new opportunity.
It's a corporate spirit, and I think the business spirit can be the most powerful tool against the <unk> of <unk>
They provide young people to be the creators of the economic opportunities that are looking so hard.
And you can train the youngsters to be entrepreneurs.
I want to talk to you about a young man who attended one of my meetings, Mohamed <unk> a <unk>
I was <unk> to train some of the young people at the summit of business and how to be innovative and how to create a culture of business initiative.
In fact, it's the first <unk> that <unk> has seen in over 22 years, and even recently, until Mohamed arrived, if you wanted the flowers for your <unk> <unk> we were from plastic to go overseas.
If you ask someone, "When was the last time you saw flowers <unk>
For those who grew up during the civil war, the answer would be <unk>
So, Mohamed saw an opportunity.
It started a company of <unk> and design.
I created a farm in the outskirts of <unk> and started growing <unk> and <unk> who said, they could survive the hard climate of <unk>
And it started the delivery of flowers for weddings, creating gardens in houses, and the city companies -- and now it's working on the creation of the first <unk> public park in 22 years.
There's no public parks in <unk>
She wants to create a space where families, young people, can go together, and, like he says, smell the pink <unk>
By the way, he's not growing <unk> because they use a lot of water.
So the first step is to inspire young people, and in that room, the presence of Mohamed had a really profound impact on young people.
They had never thought about starting a business.
They had thought to work for an NGO, working for the government, but their history, their innovation, really really had a strong impact on them.
He forced them to look at their city as a place of opportunity.
I encouraged them to believe that they might be entrepreneurs, that might be <unk>
For the end of the day, they already had innovative solutions to some of the biggest challenges facing the city.
They provide business solutions for local problems.
So to inspire young people and create a business of business spirit is really a big step, but young people need capital to make their ideas happen.
They need expertise and guidance to guide them to the development and put it out of their business.
<unk> the young people with the resources that they need, <unk> the support they need to move from conception to creation, and create <unk> for urban growth.
For me, the business spirit is something more than starting a business.
It's creating a social impact.
Mohamed is not just selling flowers.
I think it's selling hope.
Her Park of <unk> this is how it calls it when he has created, to transform the way people see their city.
<unk> I hired kids on the street to help to rent and hold the motorcycles for him.
He gave them the opportunity to escape from the paralysis of <unk> <unk>
These young entrepreneurs are having a tremendous impact on their cities.
So my suggestion is: becoming young people in entrepreneurs, <unk> and eating their innovation <unk> and they will have more stories about flowers and Parks of Peace <unk> and <unk> of <unk>
Thank you.
I was about 10 years old, and I went to <unk> with my dad in the <unk> <unk> an area called the north of New York City.
It was a beautiful day.
The forest <unk>
The sun would make the leaves <unk> like a <unk> and not to be on the path that we were able to <unk> we could almost pretend we were the first human beings on step that land.
We get to our camp.
It was a shed in a <unk> with sight of a beautiful Lake <unk> when I discovered something horrible.
Behind the shed there was a <unk> of about four square meters with apple hearts with apple hearts and <unk> blue <unk> and <unk>
And he was <unk> I was very angry and incredibly <unk>
The <unk> that were too lazy to pull out what they thought they were going to clean up their <unk>
That question went on with me, and you get a little bit.
Who clean our <unk>
No matter how you <unk> or where you <unk> the <unk> who clean our trash in <unk>
Who clean our trash in Rio or in Paris or in <unk>
Here in New York, the Department of <unk> <unk> our trash is <unk> for 11,000 metric tons of waste -- and two tons of <unk> products every day.
I wanted to know to know how individuals.
I wanted to understand who that work.
What do you feel like to use the uniform and take that <unk>
So I started a research project with them.
I traveled in the trucks and walked through her pathways, and I interviewed people in offices and installations around the city, and I learned a lot, but it was still a <unk>
I needed to get more.
So I started working as a trash <unk>
Now I didn't just travel in the trucks. I would have them.
And <unk> mechanical and <unk>
It was a remarkable privilege and an amazing learning.
They all ask about smell.
It's there, but it's not as widespread as you think, and in the days that it's very strong -- you get very strong to you.
It takes a lot of people to get into weight.
I met people who had worked on it for several years and their bodies kept taking on the weight of getting over their body tons of garbage all the weeks.
It's also the danger of danger.
According to the Office of <unk> <unk> the waste collection is one of the <unk> most dangerous <unk> in the country, and I learned the reason.
You're coming out and getting into traffic all day and moves around you.
They just want to <unk> so that the driver is not paying attention.
That's really bad for the worker.
And also the garbage itself is full of dangers that often fall from the truck and cause terrible damage.
I also learned about the trash <unk>
When you go out of the <unk> and you see a city from the back of the truck, you get to understand that garbage is like a force of nature itself.
Never stop coming.
It's also like a way of breathing or circulation.
It always needs to be moving.
And the stigma.
It seems to me that stigma is especially ironic because I believe that the <unk> of waste is the most important work in the streets of the city, for three reasons.
They're the first protective <unk>
If you don't get rid of the waste in the form of efficient and effective ways every day, this starts pouring out of their containers and their dangers inherent in very real ways.
We had been controlled for decades and centuries they come back and start <unk>
The economy needs it.
If we can't get rid of the old thing we don't have space for what the motors in the economy start to fail when it's endangered the consumption of economy.
I'm not advocating for capitalism, and I will only point its relationship.
And then this is what I call our average average rate necessary.
I mean simply at the speed that I used to be used by moving in the contemporary time.
We don't have to tell us whether or not <unk> or we have our coffee cup -- our stock market, our water bottle.
We use, the <unk> we forget about them, because we know that there's a job force on the other side that will take care of it.
So I want to suggest to you today a couple of ways of thinking about the waste of waste that maybe help reduce the stigma and <unk> in that conversation about how to design a sustainable and human city.
Her job, I think, is almost <unk>
They're in the street every day, <unk>
They use a uniform in many cities.
Do you know when we <unk>
And their work allows us to do our own.
They're almost a way of relief.
The flow that keeps us apart from ourselves, from our own <unk> our <unk> and that flow must always stay in one form or another.
One day after September 11, 2001, I heard the <unk> of a waste collection of waste on the street, grabbed my little son, and I went down the stairs and there was a man doing his journey of recycled paper as I did all the <unk>
And I tried to thank my work that particular day -- but I started to cry.
And I looked at me and just <unk> and said, "We're going to be okay.
We're going to be okay."
Shortly after that I started looking at the collection of waste and I went back to see that man.
It's called <unk> we work together so many times and we made good friends.
I want to believe that I was right.
Let's be okay.
But in our efforts to <unk> the way we exist on this planet as a species we have to embrace and have to account all the costs, even the very real human cost.
<unk> waste what we think when we talk about trash, they represent three percent of the waste of the nation.
It's a remarkable statistic here.
So in the flow of their days and their lives, the next thing you see someone whose work is to clean up the garbage of you, <unk> a moment to <unk>
<unk> a moment to tell you very much.
My work is focused on the connection of thinking about our community life forming part of the environment in which architecture is naturally born and local traditions.
Today I brought two recent projects like this.
Both projects are located in emerging countries, one in Ethiopia and the other in Tunisia.
They also share the fact that the different analysis from different perspectives become an essential part of the final piece of architecture.
The first example started with an invitation to design a shopping mall, in the capital of Ethiopia, Addis <unk>
This is the kind of building that showed us as an example to my team and me, about what we had to design.
At first, the first thing I thought was, "I want to get out of <unk>
After seeing some of these buildings there are many in the city we realized there are three important aspects to <unk>
In principle, these buildings are almost empty because they have very large stores where people can't afford to buy things.
Second, you need to employ a lot of energy because the <unk> <unk> makes heat inside the interior, so you need a lot of <unk>
In a city that this is not supposed to happen because it's a temperate weather that goes from 20 to 25 degrees throughout the entire year.
And thirdly, he looks like nothing to do with Africa not with Ethiopia.
It's a shame for a place that was so rich in culture and traditions.
In our first visit to Ethiopia, I was really <unk> with the old market that is this structure to the air -- where thousands of people, go and buy things every day to little <unk>
There's also that idea of using public space to generate external activity.
So I thought, that's what I really wanted to design, not a commercial center.
But the question was how to build a new building building, of several stories, applying these principles.
The next challenge was presented to the site -- which is located in a very much area of a lot of growth in the city, where a lot of the buildings that we see in the image, not exist.
And it's also between two parallel streets that are not communicating in an extension of hundreds of meters.
So the first thing we did was to create a connection between these two streets, linking all the entries in the building.
And this goes into a <unk> <unk> <unk> that creates a space to the air in the building which is <unk> by its own shape of sun and rain.
And around this space we've applied the idea of the market with small businesses, which changes every floor because of the way of space.
I also thought, how to close the building?
I wanted to find a solution that we would bring to the local climate conditions.
And I started thinking about a tissue that has similar to a <unk> concrete with <unk> to allow the air input and also in a <unk> way.
We then inspire us in these beautiful buttons in the dresses of the <unk>
They have properties of fractal geometry, and this helped me model it.
We're building that with these little <unk> pieces that are the windows that leave air and light in a controlled way inside of the building.
This is <unk> with these little colored crystals that use the light inside of the building to illuminate the building at night.
With these ideas it wasn't easy to convince the developers because they thought, "That's not a mall.
But ultimately we realized that this idea of market was going to be much more profitable than the commercial center because they had more local to sell.
And also the idea of the facade it was much more economic -- not only because of the material compared to glass, but also because it was no longer necessary to be <unk>
So we get certain savings in the budget that we use to implement the project.
The first thing was to think about how to achieve the energy <unk> for the building in a city where electricity is almost every day.
So we got a big advantage by putting <unk> on the roof.
And then under those panels we think of the roof as a new public space with areas of meeting and bars that would create this urban 1980s.
And these <unk> on the roof, which are collected water from the inside.
It is expected for the beginning of the next year, because we go through the fifth floor of construction.
The second example is a master of 2,000 apartment and services in the city of Tunisia.
And to do a big project, the bigger that I ever designed, I needed not only to understand the city of Tunisia, but also their environment, and their tradition and culture.
During that analysis, I put special attention into the <unk> a <unk> structure of <unk> that was surrounded by a wall with twelve gates connected by almost straight lines.
When I went to the place, the first design design that we did was expand the streets and creating 12 early blocks in size and features in Barcelona and other cities with these <unk>
In addition to that, we choose some <unk> points in relation to the idea of interconnected doors with straight lines, and this changed the initial model.
And the last operation was to think about the cell, the little cell in the project, like the apartment, as an essential part of the master plan.
I thought, what would be the best orientation for an apartment in <unk> climate.
And it's <unk> because it creates a thermal difference between both sides of the house, and so a natural ventilation.
So we <unk> a framework that claims most of the apartments are perfectly <unk> in that direction.
And this is the result that's almost like a combination of the European <unk> and the Arab city.
It has these blocks with <unk> and then in the lower plant we have all the connections to <unk>
And also it responds to local standards that set a higher density at higher levels and lower density in the low plant.
And it also reinforces this idea of the doors.
The roof, which is my favorite space of the project is almost how to give the community the space that was occupied by construction.
It's where all the neighbors, they can go up and forth and make activity such as a race of two kilometers in the morning, or jump from one building to another.
These two examples, have a common approach in the design process.
And in addition, they're in the emerging countries, where you can see cities that are literally growing.
In these cities, the impact of architecture in people's lives changes the communities and local economies at the same pace that grow the buildings.
For this reason, I see even more important to look at architecture for simple solutions, but <unk> that improve the relationship between the community and the environment, and they have as a goal to connect nature with people.
Thank you very much.
When I was eight years old, a new girl entered our class. It was as remarkable, as you see all the new girls.
He had huge amounts of hair very bright and a small <unk> of cute. It was super strong for the capitals of the states, very good for <unk>
And I ended up that year, and I was full of <unk> until I <unk> my sinister sinister plan.
One day I stayed at a time after the <unk> I was a little afternoon, and I joined the bathroom of girls.
When the coast was <unk> salt, I went into the classroom, I took the head of my teacher the book grades.
And then I did.
I put ratings from my <unk> -- just a little bit, just a few examples.
All right.  And I set myself back to the book to <unk> but to see, some of my other partners had very good notes as well.
So in a <unk> <unk> the notes around the world, without any imagination.
I put all of them out of <unk> and I just line up a row out of it, just for being there, because I <unk>
I'm still surprised what I did.
I don't understand how the idea came started.
I don't understand why I felt well doing it.
I felt important.
I don't understand why I never <unk>
It's that it was all obvious <unk>
I never <unk>
But most of all, I was fascinated by the reason why I was bothered by that this little <unk> was so good at <unk>
The jealousy.
They're so <unk> and so <unk>
We know that babies suffer from jealousy.
And the birds also primates.
We know that <unk> are the number one cause of spouses in the United States.
And yet, I've never seen a study that will observe loneliness, or long duration or the sadness.
So you have to go to fiction, because novels are like the lab where you study them, in all their possible shapes.
In fact, I don't know if it's an exaggeration to say that if there was no <unk> it would have also literature.
Well, there would be no <unk> I would have no <unk>
There would be no king <unk> or <unk> and a <unk>
I wouldn't have Shakespeare.
I spent the lists of high school from high school, because we'd be losing "The <unk> and the <unk> would have no <unk> no <unk>
Without <unk> there's no <unk> I know it's fashionable to say that <unk> has the answers for everything, and in terms of the <unk>
Now, this year was 100 years of their masterpiece "In <unk> for the most <unk> study of sexual <unk> and also from ordinary <unk> my own, my whole thing we could have.  And thinking about <unk> we have the details -- right?
We think of a child trying to reconcile sleep.
We think of a <unk> <unk> in <unk>
We forgot how hard that image is.
We forget about how <unk> it is.
I mean, it's about books that Virginia <unk> said were so hard as a cat.
I don't know what the cat is, but we assume it's <unk>
Let's see why they go so well together, the novel and the <unk> the <unk> and <unk> them.
It's going to be very obvious as it is that the benefits that get reduced to the person, their wish, to their <unk> are a <unk> base base.
I don't know. I think we get very close to bone, when we think about what happens when we manage jealousy.
When we feel better, we tell ourselves a story.
A story about other people's lives and those stories make us feel terrible because they're designed for that, to make us feel bad.
To be the storytellers and audience, we know exactly what details are <unk> to <unk> the knife -- right?
<unk> do all of these <unk> and that is something that I was understood.
Everything that she does to give me pleasure could be pleasure -- maybe myself."
And it starts to say to yourself that story, and since then, <unk> says that every single <unk> that <unk> senses on his lover, adds up to his collection of instruments of torture in his private camera.
You have to admit that <unk> and <unk> were notoriously <unk>
You know, the <unk> of <unk> would have to leave the country, if they wanted to break it with it.
But you don't have to be so <unk> to recognize that it's hard work. Right?
<unk> are <unk>
Is it an outrageous emotion. You have to <unk>
And what are the <unk>
The <unk> will spread out of information.
<unk> use the details.
The <unk> you like the big <unk> and the cute little little hair <unk>
The <unk> came out of the photos.
That's why <unk> is so successful --  -- <unk> links good language with jealousy.
When <unk> is in his <unk> agony of <unk> listening to the doors and <unk> the <unk> of his lover -- then they follow those behaviors.
He says, "Look, I know you think this is <unk> but it's not different to the interpretation of an old text or looking at a <unk>
He says, "These research research with real value <unk>
<unk> is trying to demonstrate that <unk> you see <unk> and they make us seem <unk> but in their <unk> they are search for knowledge, search for truth, a painful truth -- in fact, what we can do, the more the more painful the truth, the more the truth, the better.
The pain, the <unk> the <unk> These were the <unk>
He says, "A woman who we need, who makes us suffer, causes us to make a lot of more profound feelings that a wise man who can tell us.
It's telling us we're going to look for women <unk>
No. I think it's trying to say that <unk> reveal ourselves.
And there's some other emotion that makes us open us from this very particular way.
There is some other emotion to us, our <unk> our horrible ambition and our <unk>
Any other emotion that teaches us to look at the intensity so <unk>
Freud would write about this later on.
One day, Freud was visited by a very <unk> young man who was consumed with the idea that his wife was doing it.
And Freud says that there was something bizarre in that man, that he didn't be <unk> on what his wife.
Because she was <unk> everybody knew it.
The poor creature was under suspicion without any cause.
But he was looking for things that his wife, without realizing it, <unk> behaviors.
<unk> <unk> or don't accidentally accidentally come up with a man?
Freud said that the man was becoming the <unk> of the unconscious, of his wife.
The novels are very good at this.
<unk> describe very well how the <unk> make us look at intensity but not accurately.
In fact, the more intensely <unk> we are, we become the residents of fantasy.
And for this reason, I think, <unk> lead us to nonviolent acts or illegal.
<unk> are driving us to behave in totally <unk> ways.
Now I'm thinking about myself for the eight years -- I think, but I'm also thinking about this story that I heard in the news.
A University of Michigan from 52 years old was captured by having created a false account on Facebook since they were sending horrible messages to himself, for a year.
For one year, a whole year.
She was trying to <unk> the new girlfriend of his former <unk> boyfriend. I have to confess that when I or this, reacted to awe.
Because, let's be realistic.
How huge -- even though <unk> creativity.
It's like novel.
Like a <unk> novel, <unk>
<unk> is one of my favorites.
She's a very strange and brilliant character.
This is the author of <unk> in a <unk> and "The <unk> Mr. <unk> books about how our minds are dealing with the <unk> and once we are in the sphere, in the realm of <unk> the membrane that separates what it might be, can be <unk> in a second.
Let's take Tom <unk> his most famous character.
Tom <unk> goes from <unk> or want to want what you have to take on your own and <unk> of what you ever <unk> and it's under the floor. <unk> your name, carries your rings, empty your <unk>
It's a way.
But what do we do? We can't take the route to Tom <unk>
I can't tell you all over the world, as much as I wanted to.
It's a pity, because we live in times of envy.
We live in times of jealousy.
I mean, we're good citizens of social media, where the currency is <unk> right?
The novels show us <unk> I'm not sure.
So we're going to do what the characters always do when they're not sure, when you're in front of a mystery.
Let's go to <unk> <unk> and ask for <unk> <unk>
When people think of <unk> they think about <unk> <unk> in Professor <unk> that criminal genius.
But I've always been able to tell <unk> <unk> <unk> the head of rat <unk> <unk> <unk> who needs <unk> <unk> needs the <unk> genius, but it bothers him.
Oh, <unk> sounds so <unk>
<unk> needs their help, but they got it out, and you know, with <unk> in the each puzzles.
But as they work together, something starts to change, and finally in "The <unk> of the <unk> <unk> once <unk> <unk> <unk> all of his solution, <unk> goes back to <unk> and says, "We're not <unk> Mr. <unk>
We are proud of <unk>
And he says that there's no person in <unk> <unk> who wouldn't want to <unk> your hand.
It's one of the very few times that we see <unk> came in history. It seems to me that scene is also mysterious, right?
It seems to treat <unk> as a problem of geometry, not emotion.
You know, in a minute <unk> is the opposite side of <unk>
The next minute are the same side.
All of a sudden, <unk> it allows you to admire that idea of being the <unk>
It could still be so easy?
What if <unk> are really a matter of geometry, just a matter of where we allow ourselves to be in relation to the other?
Well, maybe we don't have to <unk> the excellence of the other.
We can deal with it.
But I like <unk> plans.
So as we hope that that happens, we remember that we have the fiction for <unk>
Just fiction -- jealousy.
fiction used to <unk> invites them to the table.
And look at what you <unk> the sweet <unk> the scary thing Tom <unk> the crazy <unk> <unk> <unk>
We are in excellent company.
Thank you.
We used to solve big problems.
On July 21, of 1969, Buzz Aldrin jumped outside the <unk> of Apollo 11 and went on the Sargasso Sea.
Armstrong and Aldrin were alone, but her presence in the <unk> gray was the culmination of a collective process.
The Apollo program was the biggest mobilization.
To get to the moon, NASA spent about 180 billion dollars today, or four percent of the federal budget.
<unk> gave a job for a 400,000 people and asked collaboration 20,000 businesses, universities and government agencies.
They died, including <unk> crew 1.
But before the Apollo program <unk> 24 men went to the moon.
<unk> walked on his surface, of which he was fired after the death of Armstrong last year, is now the most <unk>
So why do we <unk>
They didn't get a lot of <unk> <unk> pounds of old rocks, and something that 24 percent later, a new sense of <unk> and the fragility of our common home.
Why <unk> The cynical answer is that they were because the Kennedy president wanted to demonstrate to the <unk> that this nation had better rockets.
But the words of Kennedy at the University of Rice University, give us a better idea.
John F. <unk> Some people ask, why do you <unk>
Why do we turn our goal?
And you might ask, why can you climb the most <unk> mountain here.
35 years ago, why fly on the <unk>
Why does he play Rice versus <unk>
We chose to go to the moon.
We chose to go to the moon.
We chose to go to the moon in this decade, to do other things, not because they're simple, but because they're hard.
Jason <unk> For the <unk> the <unk> wasn't just a victory of the West on the back of the Cold War.
At the time, the stronger emotion was the <unk> of the powers of technology.
It was because it was something great to be able to do it.
The landing on the moon occurred in a context of a long list of technology, technology.
The first half of the 20th century produced the assembly line and the plane, penicillin and the vaccine for tuberculosis.
In the middle of the century, <unk> <unk> and eliminated the smallpox.
Technology looked like Alvin <unk> in 1970 called <unk> <unk>
For most of the history of humanity, we couldn't go faster than a horse, or a <unk> ship -- but in 1969, the Apollo crew of Apollo 10 flew at 40,000 miles / hour.
From 1970, no human being returned to the moon.
No one has traveled faster than <unk> crew <unk> and the joyful optimism about the power of technology has been <unk> to see that problems that we imagine that technology would solve like going to Mars, create a clean energy, cure cancer, or feed the world population, seem to be <unk>
I remember seeing the <unk> of <unk> <unk>
I was five years old, and my mother told me that I didn't belong to the escape <unk> tube of the rocket Saturn <unk>
I knew that this would be the last <unk> mission, but I was completely sure that I would get to see colonies on Mars.
So this is what it happened to our ability to solve problems with <unk> has become a common place.
We hear it all the time.
We've heard it for the two days here, at TED.
It seems like the technologists would have occurred to us and you had enriched toys, things like <unk> and social media and algorithms or algorithms that speed <unk> <unk>
There's nothing wrong with most of these things.
They've <unk> our lives.
But they don't follow the great problems of humanity.
What happened?
There's an explanation in the Silicon Valley, which <unk> that have been created by less ambitious companies than <unk> from the years that they <unk> and Microsoft, Apple and <unk>
Silicon Valley says that markets are the guilty, in particular, the incentives that venture capitalists offer the entrepreneurs.
Silicon Valley says that the risk investment caused us to create <unk> creating ideas for <unk> problems or even false problems.
But I don't think this explanation is good enough.
<unk> mainly what's going wrong in <unk> Valley.
Even when venture capitalists were at their high high point without worrying about the risk -- they preferred small investment investment, small investments that they could go out in 10 years.
<unk> have always been problems to invest with benefit in technologies as energy, which need a massive capital and whose development is in the long term. They also have not invested in the development of intended technologies, intended to solve great problems because they don't have any commercial value.
No, the reasons why we can't solve the big problems are more complicated and profound.
Sometimes, we chose not to fix the big problems.
Could we go to Mars if we go to it.
NASA has even designed a plan.
But going to Mars would require a political decision that was popular, and that will never happen.
We're not going to go to Mars because everybody thinks there are more important things to do on Earth.
Sometimes, we can't solve the big problems because political systems fail.
Today, less than two percent of the world's energy consumption is from renewable energy from the solar and wind and <unk> Less than two percent, and the reason is completely cheap.
coal and natural gas are cheaper than solar and wind, and oil is cheaper than the <unk>
We want alternative energy sources that can compete at price.
Now, technologists, traditional entrepreneurs and economists are according to what policies and treated with international treaties -- the development of <unk> energy, a significant increase in research and development development and some kind of control of the price of coal.
But there is no hope in the present political climate that we will see an American energy policy or international treaties that consensus.
Sometimes, the big problems that they seem technological, they are not to be.
We know for a long time that famines are a result of failure in the food reward.
But 30 years of research have taught us that famines are political crisis that affects the distribution of food.
Technology can improve things like harvest or systems for storage and food route, but there will be famines while there were bad governments.
And finally, the big problems are sometimes <unk> a solution because we don't understand the problem.
President Nixon would declared war to cancer in 1971, but soon we found that there are many types of cancer, some terribly resistant to treatment, and only in the last 10 years, they seem to have found effective treatments and viable.
The hard problems are difficult.
It's not true that we can't solve the problems with technology.
We can and <unk> but these four elements have been <unk> The political leaders and the population must want to want to solve the problem, the institutions must support the <unk> it must be really about a problem that we need to understand it.
The <unk> mission that has become something like a metaphor for the capacity of technology to solve great problems, it serves with those <unk>
But it's a <unk> model in the future.
We're not in <unk>
There's no <unk> competition like the Cold War, there is no politician like John Kennedy that <unk> difficult and dangerous, and there is no science science science like exploring the solar system.
In general, going to the moon turned out to be simple.
I was only three days.
And really, I was not even <unk> no problem.
We are alone in our present, and the solutions of the future will be harder to get.
God knows we don't have the challenges.
Thank you very much.
Well, I'm going to talk about trust, and I'm going to start with <unk> ideas -- that you have about trust.
They're so common that they've become <unk> in our society.
I think it's three.
The first is a <unk> there's been a huge decline of trust, it's a very general statement.
The second is a goal: we should have more confidence.
And the third is a <unk> we should regain trust.
I think that <unk> the goal and the task have been <unk>
What I'm going to try and tell you today is a different story about a <unk> a goal and a task, which I think gives you a more clear idea about the subject.
First of all, why people think trust has <unk>
And if I think about the basis of my own <unk> I don't know the answer.
I bow to think that there may have gone down in some activities or institutions and that might have increased in others.
I don't know it.
But I can go to the opinion surveys and opinion surveys are supposed to be the source of belief that trust has decreased.
When you look at the opinion polls over time, there are no evidence of it.
I mean, the people who were <unk> 20 years ago, mostly journalists and politicians, they are still creating the same <unk>
And the people who were very reliable about 20 years ago, they are still quite <unk> by nurses.
The rest of us are in the middle, and by the way, the average citizen of the street is almost exactly the middle of the road.
But is this evidence for enough?
What opinion polls are, of course, opinion.
What else can you get?
What you see is the <unk> attitudes that people feel when they ask them certain questions.
<unk> in the <unk> <unk> in the <unk>
Now, if somebody asked you, <unk> in the <unk>
<unk> in the <unk>
<unk> in the <unk> teachers.
I probably <unk> by asking, "What do what?"
And that would be a very sensible answer.
And you could say, when you've answered your question, "Well, I trust some, but in other no."
What's very rational.
Ultimately, in real life, we tend to deposit trust in a <unk>
We don't assume that the confidence level we're going to feel for a given kind of official <unk> official or a guy who is going to be uniform in all cases.
I could, for instance, say that I trust a certain elementary teacher that I know to give the kind of reading, but not a way to drive the school <unk>
After all, I could know that it wasn't a good <unk>
I could trust my most <unk> friend to keep a conversation, but no, maybe a secret.
Simple.
And if we've got those evidence in our everyday lives in the way that trust is <unk> why we stop all that knowledge when we think about trust in a more <unk> way.
I think these surveys are very bad tools to measure the real level of real trust, because they're trying to get the good judgment of trusting something or somebody.
Secondly, what about the goal?
The goal is to have more confidence.
Frankly, I think it's a <unk>
That's not the goal that I <unk>
I will encourage you to have more confidence in what is <unk> of trust, but not what it isn't.
Ultimately, I am <unk> of not trusting what it's not reliable.
And I think that those people who are holding their savings with the very <unk> called Mr. <unk> who then disappeared with them, I think, well, yeah, they were too <unk>
Having more confident is not a smart purpose in this life.
<unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> that's the right target.
Once you say, yes, yeah, yeah, that means that what matters in the first place is not trust, but trustworthiness.
What is about making a judgment on how reliable people are in certain ways.
And I think to be able to do a trial, we're forced to focus on three things.
They're <unk> They're <unk> They're <unk>
And if we found that a person is <unk> in the <unk> and it's responsible and honest, then we'll have a very good reason for trusting it, because it's going to be worthy of trust.
But if, on the contrary, they're not responsible we could not trust them.
I have friends who are <unk> and honest, but I don't want to get them in to take a letter to the mail because they're <unk>
I have friends that are very sure that they can do certain things, but I see that they will be able to do certain <unk>
And I'm glad to say I think I don't have a lot of friends that are competent and responsible but extremely <unk>
If this is that, I still haven't been <unk>
But that's what we're going to do before we trust.
<unk> is the answer.
<unk> is what we need to do?
And of course, it's hard.
In the last decades, we've been trying to build systems of accountability for all sorts of institutions, <unk> officials and others, that made us easier for us to judge their trustworthiness.
Many of those systems have had the opposite effect.
They don't work like <unk>
I remember once I was talking to a <unk> and he said, "Well, you'll see the problem is that it takes more time to make <unk> <unk> that will go to <unk>
And we found the same problem in all of our public life, and we would argue that the accountability system that is destined to secure the <unk> and the testing of <unk> is actually doing the opposite.
What they do is <unk> the work of people who have to do hard tasks like the <unk> <unk> that we <unk> the <unk> as we say.
You may all know some similar examples.
And so we got all of that, for the target.
I think the goal should be more <unk> and that things would be different if it will be a sense of trust to trust, and we will tell people that we're reliable and if we try to determine whether other people or officials or politicians are worthy of trust.
It's not easy. It's the trial, simple actions -- which doesn't do properly.
Third, the task.
Let's go to the task to rebuild trust, puts things upside down.
It suggests that you and I should rebuild the trust.
Well, we can do it with ourselves.
We can rebuild a little bit of trustworthiness.
We can do it if they're two people, together, trying to improve trust.
But trust, ultimately, it's <unk> because they give us a lot of other people.
You can't reconstruct what other people have given you.
You have to give them the wings enough so you can trust you.
You have to be worthy of trust.
And that, of course, is because of course, it doesn't be <unk> by all people, all the time.
But you also have to bring <unk> evidence that you're worthy of trust.
How do you do it?
That makes every day, everywhere, the common people, the <unk> the institutions -- very effectively.
I'll give you a simple commercial example.
The store where I buy my socks and says I can <unk> it without giving <unk>
I take them and take your money off, or change it for the color I want.
That's great. I trust them because they become vulnerable to me.
I think there's a great lesson in that.
If you become vulnerable to the other hand, that's a very good proof that you are worthy of trust and you have confidence in what you're saying.
So in the end, I think what we're pointing is not something very difficult to <unk>
What people trust is in relationships, and in that framework, they can determine when and how the other person is worthy of trust.
Thank you.
Since the beginning of computers we've been <unk> by reducing the separation between us and the digital information, the separation between our material world, and the world of the screen that the imagination can be <unk>
This separation has gone increasingly increasingly and more and more, to such a point that today is one millimeter, the thickness of a glass of glass, and the power of computing has become accessible to everyone.
But I ask myself, and if I had no <unk>
I started imagining what it would be.
First of all, I created this tool that <unk> in digital space, so that when the strong <unk> against the screen is their physical body to <unk>
The designers can prescribe their ideas directly in 3D, and surgeons can practice virtual organs underneath the screen.
So with this tool they break the barriers.
But the two hands remain out of the screen.
How do you get inside and interact with digital information using the whole dexterity of the hands?
In the <unk> Science division of Microsoft, along with my mentor <unk> <unk> <unk> the computer and transformed a small space on the keyboard in a work area of work.
It <unk> a transparent bombsight with camera cameras to detect the fingers and the face, you can now raise the hands of the keyboard, get inside of the 3D space, and grab pixels directly with your hands.
Like windows and files have a location in real space, <unk> is so easy to grab a book from a <unk>
You can flip through the book and point out lines or words with the virtual touch sensor that is down from every floating screen.
Architects can stretch or rotate their models directly with hands.
In these examples, we type in the digital world.
And if you invest the papers and make the digital information to us?
We had a lot of us ever bought and returned to the Internet.
Now that doesn't have to worry.
What I have here is a virtual <unk> on the Internet.
This is the vision that you get from a device mounted on your head or <unk> when the system understands the geometry of your body.
If we took this idea further, I thought, instead of just seeing pixels in space, how can we make them be physicists so that we can <unk> and <unk>
How would a future like this?
At the MIT Media Lab, with my tutor Hiroshi Ishii, and my <unk> <unk> Post, we created this only physical <unk>
This magnet <unk> behaves like a 3D pixel in space, which means that both the computer as the users can move the object anywhere in this small three-dimensional space.
<unk> what we did was we <unk> the gravity and control the movement through a combination of <unk> and <unk> and <unk>
And when you digitally file the object, we release it from the constraints of time and space, which means that human movements can go back and get to reproduce and stay in the physical world.
You can teach physically and physically distance and famous for Michael Jordan, you can reproduce as a physical reality that we want to.
Students can use it as a tool to understand complicated concepts like the obvious concepts of planets, physics, and, unlike the monitors or textbooks, this is a real and palpable experience that you can play and feel. It's very powerful.
But what's more fascinating to change the computer physics of the computer is to imagine how to program the world is going to change our everyday physical activities.
As you can see, digital information is not just going to show you something but to begin to act directly on us as part of the physical world that surrounds us without us with our world <unk>
We started the talk today talking about a barrier, but if you put that barrier, the only limit that's left is our imagination.
Thank you.
I was <unk> to become <unk> for two years in <unk> China, in the 1960s.
When I was in first grade, the government wanted to join a school to athletes all expenses them.
But my tiger mother said, "No."
My parents wanted me to become engineering, like them.
After they survive the Islamic Revolution, they create firmly that there was just a very accurate path towards the <unk> safe job and <unk> work.
No matter whether I want it or not.
But my dream was to be an Chinese opera guy.
This was my imaginary piano.
An opera singer must start <unk> from very young to learn the <unk> so I tried everything I could to go to the opera school.
I even wrote to the director of the school and the host of a radio show.
But no adult would give you the idea.
No adult took me seriously.
Only my friends told me, but they were children, without authority, like me.
So at the age of 15 years, I knew that it was too much more to train.
My dream is never <unk>
<unk> that during the rest of my life a second class happiness was the only thing I could aspire to.
And this was so unfair.
So I decided to look for another <unk>
No one for me I wanted to do -- OK.
I went to books.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in 1995, and what were the first books I did here?
The ones that were <unk> of course.
"The Good <unk> is about Chinese life.
And it's not propaganda <unk>
The Bible is interesting, but funny.
That's a topic for another day.
But the fifth commandment for me was a <unk> <unk> to your father and your mother."
I said, "It's so different, and so much better than <unk>
So it became my tool to get out of this <unk> trick, and to reset the relationship with my parents.
The encounter with a new culture also led to my <unk>
We have a lot of perspectives.
For instance, this map seemed to me out of place because this is what students in China learn.
I never occurred, that China didn't have to be in the center of the world.
A map involves people's perspective.
comparative reading is not a new thing.
It's a common practice in the academic world.
There are to research camps as a comparative religion and literature.
<unk> and <unk> offers the academics a deeper understanding of a subject.
And I thought that if the comparative reading worked for research, why not do it as well in life <unk>
So I started reading books from two.
They can be <unk> <unk> from Walter <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> from David <unk> who were involved in a same <unk> or friends with <unk> experiences.
For Christ, the <unk> are economic and political and spiritual ones.
To Buddha, it's all <unk> lust, fear and <unk> Interesting.
If you know another language, it's also fun to read their favorite books in two languages.
["The <unk> <unk> Thomas <unk> ["The <unk> ["The <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> -- I found that you can win a lot of it.
For instance, it's through the translation that I realized that <unk> Chinese means <unk> <unk> <unk>
And <unk> in Chinese, literally means <unk> <unk> <unk>
The books opened me a magic door to connect with people from the past and the present.
I know I'm not going to be feeling alone or powerless never.
Having a <unk> dream is really nothing compared to what many others have <unk>
I've come to believe that the realization is not the only purpose of a dream.
The most important purpose is to connect with the place that come from dreams, where the passion, where the passion comes from.
Until a <unk> dream can do that for you.
And because of the books, which I'm here today, happy, living again with purpose and clearly, most of the time.
So the books are always <unk>
Thank you.
Thank you.  Thank you.
When I was in my <unk> I saw my first customer <unk>
I was a Harvard student in clinical psychology, at Berkeley.
She was a <unk> woman called <unk>
Alex walked into the first session using jeans and a <unk> meeting was dropped on my office and pulled the shoes and told me that I wanted to talk about her problems with men.
When I heard this, I felt so <unk>
My class partner had a <unk> as a <unk>
And I had a <unk> I wanted to talk about men.
I thought I could handle it.
But I didn't.
With the <unk> stories that Alex led me to the sessions, made me easy only to move the head as we get to the solution.
"The <unk> are the new <unk> he said, Alex, and what I saw -- she was right.
You start to work after that, you start home later, she has children later, to death later.
For me as Alex and I had plenty of time.
But shortly later, my <unk> pushed me to push Alex who would talk about his life <unk>
I was <unk>
I said, "Sure, he's coming out with guys under his category, <unk> with a <unk> head, but it's not like it was to marry him."
And then my <unk> <unk> said, "It's still not, but maybe he gets <unk>
In addition, the best to work on Alex marriage is before you get stuck.
This is what psychologists call a <unk> moment.
It was when I realized the <unk> are not the new <unk>
Yes, people sit on the head after what they were, but this didn't have the <unk> of Alex being a pause in their development.
This made the <unk> of Alex were the perfect moment and we were <unk>
So I realized, this kind of <unk> <unk> was a real problem, and I had real consequences, not only for Alex and his loving life, but for the careers, the families and the future of <unk> everywhere.
There are 50 million <unk> in the United States, today.
This means 15 percent of the population, or 100 percent if you think no one comes to adulthood without spending before the <unk>
Raise your hand if you're in your <unk>
I want to see the <unk> here.
Oh, yeah. It's amazing.
If you work with <unk> they love a <unk> <unk> a <unk> I want to see. All right. Wow.
This is not just my opinion. These are the facts.
We know that 80 percent of the key moments in life will happen to the age of 35 years.
This means that eight of every 10 decisions and experiences and moments that shape your life will have happened to when you have 30 and <unk>
<unk> not <unk>
This audience is going to be fine, I think.
We know that the first 10 years of a career have an impact on the amount of money that we <unk>
We know that over half of Americans are married, or they live in their own future future at 30 years.
We know that the brain ends up with the second and final stage of growth in their <unk> and it <unk> for <unk> which means that if there is something you want to change from themselves, now is the moment to change it.
We know that the personality changes more times during their <unk> than at any other time in life, and we know that female fertility comes to its top for 28, and things become complicated to the <unk>
<unk> are the moment for <unk> on their body and their options.
When we think about the development of the child, we all know that the first five years are critical for language and attachment in the brain.
It's a moment in which your everyday and common life has an impact on the person who was <unk>
But what we don't hear often is there's something called adult development and our <unk> are a critical moment in adult development.
But this is not what <unk> are listening.
The newspapers talk about changes in the line of <unk>
The researchers call the <unk> a extended <unk>
The journalists gave them <unk> names like <unk> and <unk>
It's true.
As a culture, we've considered a <unk> which is actually the decade that defines the <unk>
Leonard <unk> said that to achieve great things, you need a plan and not enough time.
Isn't it true?
What do you think happens when you give a <unk> in your head and say, you have another 10 years to start your <unk>
Nothing happens.
They stole that person the sense of urgency and her ambition and it was absolutely nothing.
And then every day, young intelligent, interesting ones, like you or your children and daughters come to my office and say something like this: "I know my boyfriend is not good for me, but this relationship doesn't count. I'm just killing time."
Or they say, "All they say as a race before the 30, everything will be okay."
But then it starts to sound something like this: "My <unk> are for <unk> and I still have nothing to show you.
I was better at the day I graduated from <unk>
And then it starts to sound something like this: "My quotes during the <unk> were like the game of chairs.
They were all running and <unk> but then somewhere around 30, it crashed the music and everybody began to sit down.
I didn't want to be the only one I would sit at stop, so I sometimes think I married my husband because he was the nearest chair when I had <unk>
Where are the <unk> here?
Don't do that.
Well, that sounds a little bit extreme but not <unk> the risks are very high.
When you leave a lot of things for them, there's a huge amount of pressure to the <unk> and so many of us start a career, choose a city, to choose a couple, and have two or three children in a long time period of time.
Many of these things are not <unk> and there's research that starts to show, which is much harder and stressful to do everything once to <unk>
The middle-aged crisis is not about buying red cars.
It's about realizing you can't have the race you want now.
You realize you can't have the son you want now, or you can't give a brother to your son.
Many <unk> and <unk> you see themselves, and to me, sitting in the room, and they talk about her <unk> "What was you doing? What was you thinking?"
I want to change what <unk> are doing and thinking.
Here is a story about how it could be.
It's a story about a woman called <unk>
At 25, Emma came to my office because I was, in his own words, having an identity crisis.
He said that he would like to work in art or in the entertainment, but you couldn't still decide, so that I spent the last few years working as a <unk>
As it was cheaper, I lived with a boyfriend, who showed more <unk> than I ambition.
And in spite of living a very difficult <unk> that previous life was even more difficult.
<unk> often in our sessions, but then they wake up to say, "You don't choose your family, but you can choose your friends."
Well, one day Emma came his head on his legs and he cried for almost every hour.
I had just bought a new book book for <unk> and I had spent the whole morning <unk> with her many <unk> but then he got watching the empty space that follows after the words "In <unk> <unk> please call <unk>
I was about the <unk> when he saw me and he said, "Who is going to be for me if I have a <unk> accident.
Who is going to take care of me if it gives me <unk>
At that time, it took me a lot of work to resist and I don't mean <unk>
What Emma needed was not a <unk> that it really was <unk>
Emma needed a better life, and I knew this was his opportunity.
I had learned a lot since I worked with Alex as to just sit as the decade <unk> of Emma went to the front.
So for the next few weeks and months, I said to Emma three things that all <unk> man or woman, deserves to know.
First of all, I said to Emma who <unk> that identity crisis and identity capital.
For identity, I mean doing something that add value to your person.
Doing something that is an investment in what you want to be later.
I didn't know the future of <unk> career, and no one knows the future of work, but I know this: identity capital creates capital capital.
So now it's time for that work on the other side of the country, from that company that you want to try it.
I'm not <unk> <unk> exploration, I'm taking the exploration that I shouldn't count, which, by the way, is not exploration, by the way.
It's <unk>
I said to Emma who will explore jobs and I did it.
Second, I said to Emma that urban tribes are <unk>
The best friends are great to take you to the airport, but the people who come together with friends with friends with minds that are merely limited to who you know, what you know, how you think about it, and where they work.
That new piece of capital, that new person who will come out of it almost always comes from outside the nearest circle.
The new things come from what they call weak ties friends from their friends.
Yeah, half of the <unk> have a bad job or no job.
But the other half won't, and the weak ties are the shape of <unk> to this group.
Half of the <unk> jobs are never <unk> then, meeting the head of your neighbor is the way you get a job in <unk>
It's not cheating. It's the science of how information is happening.
Last but not least, Emma believed that you don't choose your family, but I know your friends.
This was true when I was growing up, but like <unk> Emma soon <unk> her family when he has a partner and form her own family.
I told Emma that the time to choose her family had come.
Maybe you think 30 is a better age to sit on your head than 20 or even 25 and I agree with you.
But if you choose the person that you live now or <unk> now when everybody on Facebook they start walking towards <unk> it's not progress.
The best time to work in your marriage is before you get it, and that means being so <unk> in love as you are at work.
<unk> your family must be a conscious choice of who and what you want instead of only to do it to work or kill time with whatever you choose to you.
So what happened to <unk>
Well, we looked at that <unk> and she found the roommate of a cousin who worked in a art museum in another state.
This weak <unk> helped him get a job there.
That job supply gave a reason to leave the boyfriend, that I lived alive.
Now, five years later, it's special of events in museums.
This married a man who elected consciously lost.
<unk> his new career, it loves her new family, and I send me a letter that said, "Now the spaces of emergency room are not <unk> enough.
The Emma story can sound easy, but that's what I love to work with <unk>
It's very easy to help you.
<unk> are like planes coming out of the airport in Los Angeles, who come out somewhere in the west.
Just before the <unk> one light in its trajectory makes the difference between land in Alaska or in <unk>
In the same way, at 21 or 25 and even <unk> a good conversation, a good break, a good TED Talk can have huge effects over the next few years or even the next generation.
This is my idea worth spreading to all of the people who know know.
It's as simple as I learned to say to <unk>
This is what I now have the privilege of telling <unk> as Emma every day: <unk> are not the new <unk> <unk> her <unk> get their capital capital -- use your weak holes, pick your family.
They don't have to define what they didn't know or what they didn't know.
They're deciding their life today.
Thank you.
When I was 27 years old, I left a very hard job in <unk> <unk> for a work that was even more <unk>
I was teaching students in seventh grade students in New York City.
And as any teacher, I applied tests and tests.
I love assignments.
When the work goes, <unk> grades.
What struck me about was that I.Q. was not the only difference between my best and my worst students.
Some of the ones who had a better performance had no scores of I.Q. <unk>
Some of my smartest kids were not doing so well.
And that got me thinking.
The kind of things you need to learn in mathematics in seventh grade, safe, are <unk> <unk> <unk> the area of a <unk>
But these concepts are not impossible and I was very convinced that every one of my students could learn the lesson if they worked hard and during enough time.
After several years of <unk> I came to the conclusion that what we need in education is a better understanding of students and learning from a <unk> perspective, from a psychological perspective.
In education, the only thing we know how to measure better as well.
It's the <unk> but what if you succeed in school and life depends on much more than the ability to learn how to do fast and easy?
So I left the classrooms and I went to college to become a <unk>
I started studying kids and adults in all sorts of <unk> <unk> and every study my question was, who's success here and why?
My research team and I went to the <unk> National Academy <unk>
And we tried to predict what <unk> <unk> in military training and who <unk>
We went to the National <unk> National <unk> and we tried to predict what kids were doing, the most possible in competition.
We studied faculty teachers, working in really difficult neighborhoods, what teachers are still teaching for the end of the school year and <unk> who will be the most effective in improving the results of their learning results.
We teamed up with private enterprises, which of these marketers are going to keep their <unk>
And who is going to make more money?
In all those different contexts, it emerged a feature as an important <unk> of success.
And it wasn't social intelligence.
It was not the good look, the physical health and not <unk>
It was <unk>
<unk> is passion and perseverance to achieve long-term goals.
<unk> is to have a resistance.
<unk> is clinging to their future, day after day, not only for the week, not only for the month, but for years and working really hard to make that future a reality.
<unk> is to live life as if it was a <unk> not a career.
A few years ago, I started studying the determination in the Chicago schools.
I asked thousands of high school students to do my tasks of determination and then waited about a year to see those who are <unk>
It turns out that the kids with more determination had significantly greater than <unk> even when we <unk> them in every single trait that I could measure, the family income -- the results of testing <unk> even safety they felt when they were in school.
So it's not only in West Point, or in the National <unk> National <unk> in which matters is also in school, especially for the kids at risk of <unk>
To me, the most powerful thing about determination is the little thing that we know about the science of its development.
Every day, parents and teachers ask me, "How do we develop your determination in the children?
What do I have to do to teach the kids a robust job ethic.
How do I keep them motivated for the long <unk>
The most honest answer is, I don't know.  What I know is that talent doesn't give you purpose.
Our data shows very clearly that there are a lot of talented individuals who just don't go ahead with their <unk>
In fact, in our data, that is commonly not related to or is even related to <unk> measures.
So far, the best idea I've heard about developing the determination in children is something called <unk> <unk>
This is an idea that at Stanford University by Carol <unk> and it's the belief that the ability to learn is not yet that it can change with the effort.
Dr. <unk> has shown that when kids read and learn about the brain and how it changes and grows in response to the challenge, they're much more likely to <unk> when they <unk> because they don't think that failure is a permanent condition.
So the growth mindset is a great idea to develop purpose.
But we need more.
And that's where I finish my speech, because that's where we are.
That's the work we have for the front.
We need to take our best ideas, our stronger intuitions and we need <unk>
We need to measure whether they've been successful and we need to be willing to fail, and we have to start to fail, to begin everything again with the lessons in the <unk>
In other words, we need to be determined about making our kids more <unk>
Thank you.
<unk> in Taiwan as the daughter of a <unk> one of my most popular memories is my mother <unk> the beauty, the shape and the shape of Chinese characters.
Since that moment, I was overwhelmed by this incredible language.
But for a foreigner. It looks as <unk> as the Great <unk> China.
In the last few years, I've been wondering if I can bring down this <unk> so that anyone who wants to understand and appreciate the beauty of this sophisticated language can do it.
I started thinking about how a new and quickly learning approach could be useful.
Since I was five years old, I started learning how to draw each of the strokes of every character in the right sequence.
I learned new characters every day for the next 15 years.
Because we only have five minutes, it's better than we do in a faster and simple way.
A Chinese academic <unk> <unk>
You only need a thousand to understand basic literacy to understand it.
The first 200 of them will allow you to understand 40 percent of the basic literature -- enough to read enough to read <unk> pop-up traffic signals to understand the basic idea of web pages.
Today I will start with eight to show you how the method.
Are you ready?
You open your mouth as much as you might be able to be <unk>
They get a mouth.
This is a person who's going to take a walk.
<unk>
If the shape of fire is a person with arms in both sides, like I was shouting at <unk> <unk> I am <unk> This symbol is actually <unk> in the form of called, but I like to believe that it's in the other way.
This is a tree.
tree.
This is a mountain.
The sun.
The moon.
The plate of the door looks like a couple of doors of a <unk> in the old West.
I call these eight characters.
They're building blocks so that they create many more characters.
One person.
If someone walks back, that's <unk>
As the old mentioned, the old said, two are a company, three are crowd.
If one person gets his arms, this person is saying <unk> <unk>
The person inside the mouth, the person is <unk>
It's a <unk> as <unk> inside the whale.
A tree is a tree two trees together, we have a forest.
Three trees together, we also have the forest.
Put a chart under the tree, we have the foundation.
Put a mouth on the tree, that's a <unk> --  -- <unk> to remember, because a tree is pretty idiot.
Do you remember <unk>
Two fireworks together, it's very hot.
Three fireworks together, that's a lot of flames.
Put the fire under the two trees, that's <unk>
For us, the sun is the source of prosperity.
Two <unk> together, <unk>
Three together, those are <unk>
Put the sun and the moon together, that's the <unk>
It also means morning, after one day and night.
The sun comes out on the horizon.
One door. You put a board inside the door, it's the <unk> of the door.
Put a mouth inside the door, ask questions.
<unk> played a person at home?
This person is getting hidden from a gate, <unk> <unk>
On the left, we have a woman.
Two women together, they're <unk>
Three together, they're <unk> <unk>
So we've gone for almost 30 characters.
By using this method, the first eight <unk> will allow you to build 32.
The next group of eight characters will build other 32.
So with every little effort, you will be able to learn a couple of hundreds of characters, which is the same thing you learn for a Chinese <unk>
So after knowing the characters, we started creating sentences.
For example, the mountain and fire together, we have a mountain of fire. It's a <unk>
We know that Japan is the Earth <unk>
This is a sun placed with the beginning, because Japan is in China.
So a sun next to start, we create Japan.
One person behind Japan, what do we have?
A Japanese person.
The character on the left are two mountains over the other.
In the ancient China, that meant in exile, because the Chinese <unk> to bring their political enemy beyond the mountains.
Today, <unk> has become <unk>
A mouth that tells you to go out is a <unk>
This is a slide to remind me that I have to stop talking to you and down the stage. Thank you.
What I prefer to be Dad are the movies that I get to see.
I love to share my favorite films with my <unk> when my daughter was four years old, we saw the magician of Oz together.
The film <unk> his imagination for months.
His favorite character was <unk> of course.
He gave her a good excuse to use a bright dress and take a magic wand
But when you see that film as many times, you get to understand that it's remarkable.
We now live and raise our children in a kind of complex fantasy shows of a child's child.
However, the magician of Oz was an event unto itself.
It didn't start that trend.
The trend really took rise in the past 40 years later with, again, another film whose <unk> a metal boy and a <unk> guy who was wearing a girl dresses as a <unk>
You know what I'm talking about?  Yes.
There's a big difference between these two films, there's a couple of big differences between the magician of Oz and all the movies that we see today.
One is that there are very little violence in the magician <unk>
The monkeys are pretty aggressive, like <unk>
But I think if the magician of Oz was done today, the magician would say, <unk> you're the salvation of Oz as the prophecy.
<unk> magic shoes to defeat the armies in the computer of the <unk> <unk>
But that's not what happens.
Another unique thing about the magician magician is that the most popular characters and even <unk> are women.
I started noticing this when I did "Star <unk> to my daughter, a few years later, and the situation was different.
At the time, I also had a son as well.
Over three years.
He was not invited to the projection because it was still very small for that.
But it was the second child, and the level of surveillance had <unk>  And so slid in the room and I was struck by the room and was struck by the room and I was struck like a foot in the room with his <unk> behind, and I don't think he understood what was happening, but <unk> <unk> everything.
I wonder what <unk>
They would be <unk> <unk> and <unk> and <unk>
It would be the sense that Luke was one to <unk> the government?
<unk> this with the magician of Oz <unk>
How do you make Dorothy his film?
We do good <unk> with all and being a <unk>
It's the kind of world that I want my kids to grow up to grow up, and not a world of men that I think is where we are.
Why is there so much fossil capital force in the movies for our children, and so little of the path of <unk>
There's a lot of literature on the impact of male violence in the girls, and they should be <unk> It's very good.
I haven't read so much about how kids react to this encouragement.
I know that the princess <unk> doesn't provide the right frame that I had served to navigate the world of adults who are <unk>  I think at the moment of the first kiss. I expected the kids to begin to appear because it's the end of the film, right?
My search has finished, I have a <unk>
Why are they standing there?
I don't know what I should do.
The movies are focused on defeat the headache and get your reward, and they don't leave time for other relationships or other <unk>
It's almost like a child, you have to be a dumb animal, and if you're a girl, you have to use a <unk> suit.
There are lots of exceptions, and to defend the Disney princess to any of you.
But they send a message to the children, even though them, they are not really their target audience.
They do a phenomenal job to teach girls how to fight against the <unk> but they don't necessarily show the kids how to fight their <unk>
There is no model for them.
We also have a few great women who write new stories for our children, so real and <unk> as <unk> and <unk> but they don't stop being war war.
Of course, the most successful topic of every time continues to emerge in classic by <unk> each of them on the adventure of a child or a man, or two men who are friends, or a man and her son, or two men who are raising a little girl.
Until many of you are thinking, this year, this year, finally came out.
I recommend all of you. It's already available in stores.
Do you remember what the criticism said when he came out of it.
I can't believe that Pixar is made a movie of a <unk>
It's very good. Don't let that <unk>
Well, almost none of these films is the test of <unk>
I don't know if you've heard about this.
It's still not rooted and already <unk> but maybe we're going to start a movement.
<unk> <unk> is a comic book book and in the <unk> I recorded a conversation that I had with a friend of the movies that you saw.
And it's very simple. There are only three questions that must be <unk> In the film, there's more than a female character who has <unk>
So you have to fulfill the <unk>
These women talk to each other at some point in the film?
Their conversations are about something else than the kid you like it?        Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.
Two women that exist and talk about things each other.
<unk> I've seen, and yet very rarely I see it in the cinema that we know and love.
In fact, this week I went to see a very good film -- <unk>
Right? <unk> of <unk> success -- a sense of consensus for what is a Hollywood Hollywood film.
<unk> isn't the test of <unk>
And I don't think that <unk> because a lot of the film, I don't know if you've seen it, a lot of the movie happens in a embassy where men and women are hidden during the <unk> crisis.
We have many scenes of men who have profound and painful conversations in this <unk> and it's the great time for one of the <unk> to take a look at the door and say, "Would you go to bed, <unk>
This is Hollywood.
So let's go back in the numbers.
In 2011, of the 100 films as many of them believe they have protagonists <unk>
<unk> It's not bad.
It's not the same percentage that the number of women we've chosen recently to Congress, then it's okay.
But there is a bigger number that is going to take you this room.
Last year, The New York Times published a study that the government had done.
This is what it was saying, right?
In the United States, one of five women says it's been sexually sexually ever in their life.
I don't think it's a massive entertainment <unk>
I don't think the movies for children have something to do with that.
I don't think music music or pornography are closely <unk> but something is wrong, and when I hear that statistics, one of the things I think is that there's a lot of sex <unk>
Who are those <unk> What are they <unk>
What don't they do <unk>
They're <unk> the story that says the role of a male hero is <unk> <unk> with violence and then charge the reward, which is a woman who has no friends and not <unk>
We are <unk> that story?
You know, as a father with the privilege of raising a daughter as those of you who are doing the same thing, we found this world and this very <unk> statistic and we want to give it to you.
We have tools to be like <unk> <unk> and we hope that we can ask, but I have to ask, <unk> <unk> is going to <unk> if, at the same time, active or <unk> we're educating our children to keep their kids out and keep their <unk>
I mean, I think the Netflix list is a way to do something really important, and here I mean primarily to parents.
I think we have to show our male children a new definition of <unk>
The definition of man is radically changing.
You've read about how the new economy is changing the role of the <unk> and the <unk>
It's all changing.
When I asked my daughter what she was his favorite Star Star character.
<unk>
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
What do these two?
Maybe it's not just the bright <unk>
I think they're experts.
I think these are the two people in those films that know more than anyone, and they love to share their knowledge with other people to help them reach their potential.
They're leaders.
I like that kind of stories for my daughter, and I like that kind of stories for my son.
I want more stories like that.
I want less stories to tell my <unk> go and fight only and more stories where you see her work is to join a team, maybe a team led by women, helping other people to improve and be better people, like the <unk> magician.
Thank you.
As a child, I was living in Maine and one of the things that I really liked was looking for seawater on the shores of Maine because my parents told me that I would give me luck.
But you know, it's hard to find these <unk>
There are sand covered in sand and it's hard to see them.
However, with the time, I went to <unk>
I started to see shapes and patterns that helped me <unk>
This became a passion for finding things, in a love of the past and <unk>
And finally when I started studying <unk> I realized that I can see with my own eyes not enough.
Because, suddenly, in Egypt, my little beach in Maine had grown up to one of almost 1.3 miles of length with the <unk>
And my sea cookies had grown up to the size of cities.
This is really what led me to use satellite images.
To try and do a map of the past, I knew I had to see it differently.
I want to show you an example of how different we see using <unk>
This is a place located in the eastern <unk> <unk> <unk>
And the place, in the naked eye, it seems to be brown, but when we use infrared -- and we process it using color -- suddenly the <unk> you see as a bright pink <unk>
What you're seeing are the actual chemical changes in the landscape caused by building materials and activities of ancient Egyptian.
I want to share with you how we've used satellite data to find an old city, called <unk> lost for thousands of years.
<unk> was the ancient Egypt capital for over 400 years in a period of time called the European Empire about 4,000 years ago.
The place lies in <unk> Egypt, and it's really important because in the Middle East, there was this great renaissance of ancient art -- architecture and religion.
The <unk> have always known that <unk> was located somewhere near the pyramids of two kings that <unk> <unk> inside the red circles here, but somewhere inside this huge <unk>
This area is enormous, it's about <unk> by <unk> miles.
Before, <unk> <unk> right next to <unk> and as it changed over time, it moved to this and covered all the city.
So how do you find a <unk> city in a <unk> landscape.
I'll try to find them at random it would be the equivalent of looking for a needle in a <unk> with your eyes, and using baseball <unk>
So we use NASA data from NASA to make a map of place, with very subtle changes.
We were able to see where the <unk> <unk>
But you can see more <unk> and it's even more interesting, this area is slightly more interesting, that you see within the circle here, we thought it could be the location of <unk>
So we collaborated with Egyptians doing <unk> jobs you can see here.
When I say <unk> it's like the shots of shows in ice, but instead of layers of climate change, we look at layers of human occupation of it.
Five meters down, underneath a thick thick layer, we found a dense layer of <unk>
This means that in this possible location of <unk> five meters down, we have a layer of occupation of several hundred years that date back from the Middle East, exactly the same period that we think is <unk>
We also found <unk> jobs and quartz and <unk> which shows that there was a <unk> shop.
This might seem to be not a lot, but when we think of the most common stones used in the Public <unk> jewelry, these are the stones that are <unk>
So we have a dense layer of occupation which goes back from the Middle Empire in this place.
We also have evidence of an elite team to prove that what has been there, was a very important city.
We still don't find <unk> here, but we would recognize the place in a near future for <unk>
And even more importantly, we have the resources to train young Egyptians in the use of satellite technology so that they can also perform great discoveries.
I want to end with my favorite quote from the Middle East, it's probably written in <unk> four years ago:
Let me share knowledge is the biggest of all the <unk>
There's nothing like that on Earth.
So according to it, TED was not founded in 1984 <unk> C.
Do the ideas really happen in 1984 BC.
It certainly puts the search for shells in perspective.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
I want to invite you to close your eyes.
Imagine standing outside, front of the door of <unk> home.
I want you to pay attention to the color of the door, the material that he is made.
Now let's take a bunch of obese <unk> in bicycles.
They're competing on a <unk> race and <unk> and they're in the direction to their <unk>
I need you to see this <unk>
They're <unk> strong, they're <unk> they're <unk>
And they collide with the door of your home.
There are bicycles flying all over the place, wheels on the wheels of the wheels that end up in <unk> places -- the threshold of the door.
The lobby to the hall, or what there's the other side of the door, and you see the quality of light. The light shining on the <unk> of the <unk>
They're waving with the hand.
From their chair, on a brown horse.
It's a horse that's talking about.
You can feel your blue fur, you can tickle your nose.
You can smell the <unk> and you go to the point of <unk> in the mouth.
They go through one side and enter their living room.
In the room, and making most of your imagination, imagine Britney <unk>
It's with little clothing on dancing on the middle of the center, singing <unk> One More <unk>
Now let's go to the kitchen.
The ground has been coated with a <unk> path of yellow bricks and from the oven. They come to you <unk> the Man of <unk> the <unk> and the Len of "The Wizard of <unk> <unk> of the hands, <unk> to you.
Okay. Open your eyes.
I want to tell you about a particular contest that takes every spring in New York.
It's called the <unk> <unk> of the United States."
I went to cover this event a few years ago as a <unk> journalist, I guess this was like the end of a <unk> <unk>
There were several men and a few ladies of different ages and different habits of hygiene.
They were <unk> hundreds of numbers -- <unk> only once.
<unk> the names of tens of strangers.
It took entire poems in only minutes.
You know, to see who could memorize the top of a deck of <unk>
And I thought, "This is <unk>
These people must be phenomena.
And I started talking to some of the competitors.
This is a man named Ed <unk> who had come from England and have one of the best <unk> memories.
I asked him, <unk> when you realized that you were a <unk>
Ed replied, "I am not a wise.
Actually, I have an average memory.
Everybody who deals with this competition say they have normal memory.
We said, "We have been trained to do these miraculous acts of memory by using these ancient <unk> <unk> two years ago in Greece, the same techniques that used <unk> to memorize their <unk> and that the medieval academics used to memorize <unk>
And my reaction was, "How did I have heard of this <unk>
We were standing out of the room of competition, and we were standing out of the room and <unk> who is a wonderful and brilliant English, although a little <unk> told me, <unk> you are an American journalist.
You know Britney <unk>
And I said, "What? No, why?
Because I'd like to teach Britney <unk> how to memorize the order on a deck of live live in national television.
That would prove to the world that anyone can do it."
And I said, "Well, I'm not Britney <unk> but maybe you can teach me to me.
I mean, you have to start by something not?"
And that was the beginning of a very strange journey for me.
And I ended up spending the bulk of the year, not just training my memory, but also <unk> trying to understand how it works, why sometimes it doesn't work and what their potential.
I met a lot of really interesting people.
This is a man named <unk>
He is <unk> very probably with the worst memory in the world.
Her memory was so bad that I didn't even remember that I had a problem of <unk> it's awesome.
Someone incredibly tragic, but it was a window that allowed to see how much our memory makes us who we are.
On the other end of the spectrum, I met this man.
This is Kim <unk> In he based on the role of <unk> <unk> in the movie <unk> <unk>
We spent a afternoon together in the public library in Salt Lake City, <unk> books, was <unk>
And to come back, I was a number of treated on writing about something over 2,000 years ago in Latin America -- and then in the Middle Ages.
And I learned a lot of really interesting things.
One of the most interesting things I learned is that there was a time when this idea of having the <unk> memory and disciplined and <unk> was not a thing as rare as it can look like today.
A long time ago, people invest in their memory, in order to provide their minds.
These techniques have made our modern world, but they have changed.
They have changed us, and I would say that they've changed us as well.
As we have almost no need to remember, sometimes it seems like we have forgotten how to do it.
One of the last places on our planet where you're still passionate about this idea of a disciplined and disciplined and <unk> is this very unique memory competition.
It's not really that <unk> there is a <unk> on the entire world.
I was <unk> I wanted to know how these people do.
A few years ago, a group of researchers from University College London invited a set of memory champions to the lab.
They wanted to know that it has brains in some ways, structural or different <unk> of the rest of us?
The answer was, no.
Are you smarter than <unk>
They gave them a battery of cognitive test, and the answer was actually not.
There was yet a really interesting and significant difference between the brains of the memory collection and the issues of control with that the <unk>
When they put them on a <unk> <unk> <unk> your brains as they were <unk> -- faces and forms of cotton <unk> they found that in the memory memory <unk> parts of the brain, different to others.
They actually <unk> or they seemed <unk> a part of the brain that involves spatial and navigation.
Why? There is something we can learn from this?
The tournament to <unk> competitive is driving as an armed race where each year comes up with a new way to remember more things, more quickly, and then the rest of competitors must get a day.
This is my friend Ben <unk> three times a memory.
On his desk, front of him, there are 36 <unk> of <unk> <unk> that he is about trying to memorize in an hour, using a technique that he invented and he only did.
He used a similar technique to memorize the precise order of <unk> binary <unk>
Half an hour. Yeah.
And as there's a lot of ways to remember things in these needs, absolutely all the techniques used to the end is reduced to a single concept that psychologists call <unk> <unk>
You illustrates it with a elegant paradox known as the <unk> <unk> <unk> she says, "I tell two people who remember the same word -- I'm telling you, you know, there's a man named <unk>
That's your <unk>
And then I'm asking you, <unk> there's a <unk> <unk>
And when I go back later, and I ask them <unk> that word I told you about a <unk>
Did you say what <unk>
The person who was told that his name is <unk> it's unlikely to remember the same word as the person who was told that his job is <unk>
The same word, different capacity to <unk> that is weird.
What happens here?
Well, the Baker, name is actually nothing for you. It doesn't have any relationship to you.
All the other memories they dance for their head.
But the word <unk> We know <unk>
They wear <unk> <unk>
They have <unk> <unk>
They go back home to work.
You probably know some <unk>
And when we put that word for the first time, we started putting <unk> <unk> for <unk> <unk> at some point after that.
One of the most elaborate techniques to do this dates back two years ago in Greece <unk>
It's known as the <unk> of <unk>
The story says this: There was a poet called <unk> I attended a <unk>
They had hired it as entertainment, because before, if you wanted to give a very good party, they didn't bring to a <unk> <unk> to a <unk>
He stood up <unk> her poem of memory, and he was <unk> and so soon he was the room of the <unk> <unk>
<unk> everybody.
But not only killed everybody, but it shattered the bodies to <unk>
No one could say who was there, nobody could remember where they were sitting.
So you couldn't <unk> the <unk>
A tragedy behind the other.
He stood outside, only survivor, in the middle of the rubble, closed the eyes and realized that with the eyes of his mind, I could see where I had been sitting every single <unk>
I took the relatives <unk> <unk> where their loved ones were on the rubble.
So what <unk> <unk> at that moment is something that we all know more or less <unk> and is that no matter if we're not good at remembering names or phone numbers or instructions for the word of our colleagues, we have visual memory and spatial memory.
If you ask them to tell me, the first 10 words of the history I just told you about <unk> is very likely to find it very difficult to do it.
But I would bet that if you told you to say who was sitting on the brown favorite horse in his lobby, would be able to <unk>
The idea of the palace of memory is to create this building with the eyes of your mind and image of images with the things that you want to remember the <unk> the more crazy -- the <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> be the picture, more <unk>
This is a advice that comes from over 2,000 years ago, to the first fun of memory in <unk>
And how does it work?
Let's say that you have been invited to the TED stage to give a talk and you want to do it from the same way that I would have done it -- if you invited him to <unk> 2,000 years ago.
What you could do is imagine that you're in the door of your home.
And to come up with some sort of an absolutely ridiculous, crazy image and <unk> to help you remember that the first thing you want to mention is that completely <unk> competition of it.
And then you can imagine entering your house, and you can imagine the <unk> of the <unk> mounted on <unk>
And that would remind you that you want to introduce your friend Ed <unk>
And then you'd see Britney <unk> to remind you that anecdote -- you want to tell.
And then it goes into the kitchen, and the fourth issue that they would talk about would be that strange journey that did for a whole year, and they have some friends to help them remember it.
So this is like <unk> speakers and <unk> not word for word, which is going to confuse it but typical by typical.
In fact, the <unk> term comes from the Greek <unk> which means <unk>
It's a remnant of when people thought about <unk> and rhetoric with this sort of spatial terms.
The phrase <unk> first <unk> it would be like the first place in her palace of memory.
I saw this was simply fascinating, and I got into that.
I went to some of these memory skills, and I had the idea of writing something extensively about this <unk> of competitive <unk>
But there was a problem.
The problem was that a memory competition is a <unk> event.
Really, it's kind of like seeing a lot of people sitting on exams. I mean, the most exciting thing that happens is when somebody else was <unk>
I'm a journalist, and I need to write about something.
I know there are amazing things happening in the minds of these people, but I don't have access to.
I realized that if I was going to tell this story, I needed to try to put myself in his place.
So I started spending 15 or 20 minutes all the speakers before I sit down to see the New York Times, just trying to remember something.
Maybe a poem. Or the names of an ancient <unk> school <unk> <unk>
And I discovered that this was a lot of fun.
I would never have expected you to do it.
It was fun, because it wasn't just about training memory.
What it actually is about doing is to improve more and more the ability to create and imagine these <unk> images, which is why <unk> <unk> <unk> and hopefully <unk> in the eye of the mind.
I was very excited about this.
This is me, using my standard training team for memory competition.
It's a couple of <unk> and a <unk> <unk> covered with tape leaving just two <unk> because the distraction. is the worst enemy of a memory.
And I ended up coming back to the same contest that I had covered a year before. He had the idea that I could log in, in a kind of <unk> <unk> experiment.
I thought this could be good <unk> for my whole research.
The problem was that the experiment came out of control.
And I won the <unk> something I didn't have to happen.
Of course it's nice to be able to memorize <unk> and phone numbers on the phone, but actually this is not the point.
These are just just tricks.
Because it's based on the very basic principles of how the brain works.
And you don't need to be building <unk> of memory or <unk> <unk> to benefit from a little bit of <unk> about how your mind.
We often talk about people with a great memory as if it was a <unk> gift -- but it's not the case.
The great memories <unk>
At the most basic level, we remember when we pay attention.
You focus on deeply when we focus on.
The palace of <unk> these memory techniques are just shortcuts.
In fact, they're not even <unk>
They work because they make it <unk>
<unk> a kind of profound processing -- a kind of profound attention that most of it is not <unk> over there.
But the reality is that there's no shortcuts.
That's how things do <unk>
And if there is something I want to leave you with today, is what you would do, the <unk> that I couldn't even remember that I had a memory problem, I left to me, which is the notion that life is the sum of our memories.
How much are we willing to lose what is our short existence of existence in the <unk> or <unk> not paying attention to the human being in front of us, who walks our side to our side, we will be so <unk> that we didn't even help us in process in <unk>
I learned from the first hand that there are amazing memory capacities for all of us.
But if you want to live a life -- you must be the kind of person who remembers remember.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk to you today about the last 30 years of the history of architecture.
It's a lot to cover in 18 minutes.
This is a complex topic, so you can <unk> only a place that New Jersey.
Because 30 years ago, I am a professor, and I was living there in the home of my parents in a village called <unk> and this was my bedroom as a child.
In the corner, from my bedroom, I was the bathroom I shared with my sister.
And between my bedroom and the bathroom, there was one balcony that gave the living room.
And there you all spent the time watching the television -- so every time I was going from my room to the bathroom, everybody was going to see me, and every time I got married, and I was going to go back in a towel -- everybody was looking at me.
And I was like this.
It was <unk> not and not I hated it.
He hated that journey, hated that <unk> hated that room and that house.
That's architecture.
All right.
Those feelings, those emotions that I felt, that is the power of architecture, because architecture is not about mathematics, and of division of areas, but of those connections, emotional connections, that we feel in the places that we <unk>
And it's not surprising that we feel that way, because according to the Climate Protection Agency --  Americans spend 90 percent of their time under the roof.
That's 90 percent of the time we are surrounded by architecture.
That's very much.
architecture determines us in ways that we don't even notice us.
That makes us a little naive and very, very predictable.
This means when I show you a building like this, I know what you would do, you think about <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And I know they think about it for based on a building built a half thousand years ago by the Greeks.
This is a trick.
It's a <unk> that the architects use to create an emotional connection with the ways we build our buildings.
It's an emotional connection -- we've used this trick for a long time, a long time.
We use it 200 years ago to build banks.
We used it in the 19th century to build museums in art.
And in the 20th century, in the U.S., we use it to build houses.
Look, you know, these <unk> stable solid, front of the sea, go away from the elements.
This is very, very useful, because building things is terrifying.
It's expensive, it takes a long time and it's very complicated.
The people who <unk> <unk> and governments, are always afraid of innovation, and they want to use ways that they know they're going to work.
So we found ourselves with buildings like this.
It's a nice <unk>
This is the Public Public <unk> which was finished in 2004, in my hometown, and, you know, has this round thing, and columns, <unk> red -- which is going to communicate with what you need, try to communicate with this <unk> the children, the property, the story.
But it doesn't have a lot to do with a library of today.
That same year, in 2004, the other side of the country, was a <unk> she looks like this.
It's in Seattle.
This library shows how we use media media in the digital age.
It's a new kind of public equipment.
So how is it possible that in the same year, two buildings, two buildings, both so-called libraries, are so completely different?
And the answer is that architecture works at the beginning of the <unk>
On one side is the <unk> the architects that constantly drive new technologies, new <unk> new solutions for life forms of life.
We were going to sort of <unk> and <unk> so we got out of the people.
All of the black, this tells us, you think we feel very good, but we are dead because we don't have another option.
We need to go to the other side, and we need to connect with these <unk> symbols.
We do that, and we are all happy, but we are all happy, but we start experimenting with <unk> we do <unk> the pendulum behind over and over and over again. So we've done it in the last 300 years, of course, in the last 30 years.
Well, 30 years ago we had the 1970s.
Architects were busy experimenting with called <unk>
It has to do with concrete.
So you can guess.
<unk> small, on scale.
Something really hard.
So we're approaching the 1980s, and we started to incorporate these symbols.
We put the pendulum again in the other direction.
We take those ways we know that we like and <unk>
And <unk> <unk> and we added bake and we use new materials.
I love it.
We don't give <unk>
We take <unk> closets and we turned them into a <unk> which can be <unk> medieval <unk>
The shapes were <unk> won on audacity and <unk>
<unk> became columns.
<unk> grew up to the size of buildings.
One is crazy.
But they were the 1980s, that was great.
We all spent the commercial centers, we moved to the neighborhoods, and there in the suburbs, we can create our own erotic <unk>
Those fantasies could be <unk> to French or Italian <unk>
Maybe with a <unk> of bread.
This is what happens with the <unk>
This is what happens to the symbols.
They're easy. They're cheap, because instead of creating new spaces, we create memories of other places.
I know very well, and you all know that this is not the <unk>
This is Ohio.
Architects feel frustrated and started making <unk> the pendulum again in the other direction.
In the '80s and early '90s, we started to experiment with the so-called <unk>
<unk> the <unk> symbols now we have new design techniques for computer design techniques -- and we find new <unk> a few ways that are <unk> against other ways.
This is academic and <unk> and it's super <unk> You are totally <unk>
Normally the pendulum <unk> again in the opposite direction.
But then something <unk>
In 1997, this building.
It's the <unk> of Frank <unk>
This building changed the relationship of the world with architecture.
Paul <unk> said that Bilbao was one of those rare times when critical academics and public people were completely agreed about a building.
The New York Times <unk> this building of <unk>
The tourism at Bilbao is increased by a mile when they ended up the building.
So suddenly, everybody wanted one of those <unk> Los Angeles, Seattle, Chicago, New York, Cleveland, <unk>
Everybody wanted one, and Gehry was everywhere.
He was our first medical architect.
But how is it possible that these wild forms and <unk> how is it possible that they can become a ubiquitous throughout the world?
And it happened, because the media will be transferred around them and quickly learned that those shapes meant culture and <unk>
We've created an emotional reaction with these shapes.
They did the main mayors in the world.
So everybody believed that if they had these forms, they had culture and <unk>
This phenomenon of the beginning of the new millennials spent with other architects star.
He went to <unk> and <unk> and what happened with these few elite architects at the threshold of the new millennium, actually started to spend all of the architecture, social media began to increase the speed of information consumption.
Think about how they use architecture.
A thousand years ago, they would have to have walked to the next village to see a building.
The transport is <unk> you can take a boat, an airplane, can be <unk>
<unk> technology, you can see in the newspapers, on TV, and in the end, we're all photographers of architecture, and the building is getting beyond their physical location.
The architecture is everywhere, that means that the communications speed finally has reached the speed of architecture.
Because architecture is moving so fast.
It doesn't look very precise enough to think about a building.
It takes a lot of time to build a building, three or four years old, and at that time, an architect can design two, eight, or 100 thousand buildings before you know whether the one I designed four years ago was success or not.
Because there's never been a good feedback in architecture.
That's how we met buildings like this.
The <unk> was not a <unk> movement.
For 20 years, we were building buildings like this because we had no idea how much they <unk>
That is never going to happen. It's because we are at the threshold of the largest revolution in architecture from the invention of the steel of the steel or a steel or the elevator.
My theory is that when you apply the media on the media, it starts to <unk> every time faster -- until you get in both extremes of <unk> and it was effectively the difference between innovation and symbol, between us, the architects, and you know, the audience.
Now we can make <unk> symbols of something completely new.
Let me show you how the system works in a project that my company ended up recently.
We were <unk> to replace this building which is <unk>
This is the center of a village called <unk> in <unk> Island, in New York City.
It's a community of vacation.
But that meant that two years before the building, it was already part of the community, and as the drawings looked like exactly the product, there was no surprises.
The building came to be part of the community, that first summer, when people started to come up and share it in social media, the building left to be just a building, it became a media, because these are not just images of a building, it's the images that one made of the building.
And as you use it to tell your history, you become part of the personal narrative -- and that makes it <unk> with collective memory, and when you charge these symbols, we learn.
I mean, we don't need the Greeks tell us how to think about architecture.
We can tell each other what we think of architecture, because digital media has not only changed the relationship between us, but they have changed the relationship between us and buildings.
Think about a second in those librarians in <unk>
If that building was built today, first of the Internet is looking for <unk> <unk>
We were bombarded with examples of experiment, of innovation, what can be a library.
That's <unk>
<unk> that you can take the mayor of <unk> to people of <unk> and tell them that there are no response only to what a library can be.
Let's be part of this.
This abundance of solutions gives freedom to experience.
It's all different now.
Architects are no longer those mysterious creatures that are using <unk> words and complicated, and one is no longer a <unk> audience, which doesn't embrace anything before.
The architects can listen, and you can listen to it, and you can't forget about architecture.
That means that the <unk> of a style to another, from a movement to another, is irrelevant.
In fact, we can go ahead and find right solutions to the problems facing society.
This is the end of the story of architecture, and it means that buildings in the morning will be very different from buildings today.
This means that a public space in the ancient city of <unk> can be unique and adapted to the measure of a modern city.
This means that a stadium in Brooklyn can be that, a stadium in Brooklyn, and not a bad historical <unk> historical brick of the red brick with ideas of what it should be a <unk>
This means that some robots will be able to build our buildings, because we will finally be ready for the ways that they're going to produce.
That means that the buildings were <unk> to the <unk> of nature and not the reverse.
This means that a parking shop in Miami Beach, Florida, also it can serve to make sports or for <unk> or even you can marry them at night.
This means three architects can dream of swimming in the East East <unk> in New York City, and raising half a million dollars from the <unk> community around that cause, it's not a customer alone.
It means that no building is too small for innovation, like this little pavilion of <unk> so <unk> and <unk> like animals that are going to observe.
Because no matter whether it's a cow or a robot who builds our buildings.
It doesn't matter how we build what we build.
Architects already know how to make more <unk> buildings and more kind.
We've been waiting for everybody to want.
Finally, we're not on the opposite side.
Find an architect, <unk> and <unk> together to make better buildings, better cities, for a better world, because there's a lot of play.
Buildings are not only reflecting our society, but they shape them to the most unequal spaces, the local libraries in the homes where we put our children, and their <unk>
Thank you very much.
This is my <unk> <unk>
He just turned a year and started walking.
And it does this very typical way of the children of a year, <unk> as if their body was moving too fast for your legs.
It's totally <unk>
And one of the things that we like to do for the moment is look at the mirror.
She really loves his reflection.
It <unk> and <unk> and it gives itself those big kisses and <unk>
It's beautiful.
And apparently, all of your friends do this and my mom tells me that I used to do it. And when did you stop doing this?
How do we suddenly be comfortable with our <unk>
Because, apparently, we don't like it.
Every month, 10,000 people are looking for Google "I'm <unk>
This is <unk> it's 13 years old and lives in <unk>
And as any teenager you just want to be dear and fit in.
It's Sunday at night.
It's preparing for next week in school.
It has a little bit of fear -- it's a little bit confused because, even though her mom says everything is beautiful, every day in school, someone says it's ugly.
Among what her mom says and what his friends, or fellow school people say, don't know who I believe.
So a video of her itself, he publishes it on YouTube, and he says to others who please leave a <unk> "I'm nice or I'm <unk>
Okay, so far, <unk> has received over 13 comment.
Some of these are so <unk> that it doesn't even deserve to think about them.
We talked about a normal healthy and running teenager who gets these answers into one of the most vulnerable life in their emotionally vulnerable life.
Thousands of people are posting videos like this, in their most teenage girls trying to communicate this way.
So what is it doing this?
Well, the teenagers in today almost never are alone.
They're under pressure from being online and available all the time, talking about, <unk> giving you, <unk> <unk> <unk> -- this is never been over.
Never before we've been so connected, in a continuous way, so <unk> so young.
As a mother told me, "It's like there's a party in your fourth room all <unk>
There's just no privacy.
And the social pressures that go from hand with that are <unk>
This environment, being always connected, is <unk> our children to <unk> based on the number of liking you and the kinds of comments that they do.
There's no division between a life online and the real life.
It's really difficult to know the differences between what's real or what it isn't.
And also, it's very difficult to know the difference between what's authentic and what is rigged and <unk>
What is the most prominent part of someone in front of someone who is normal in a every day?
And where are they looking for <unk>
Well, you can see the kind of images that are <unk> from girls now.
<unk> <unk> continue to dominate our <unk>
<unk> technique is routine.
And trends like, <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
For those of you who <unk> <unk> means <unk>
These trends are associated with women in the popular culture of today.
It's not hard to see what young people you do?
But kids are also not immune to this.
It's like the superheroes of the sports stars, and the folk singers and <unk>
But what's the problem with this?
Well, we certainly want our kids to grow healthy and be individuals.
But in an obsessed culture obsessed with the image, we're teaching our kids to spend more time and mental effort to their appearance, the price of everyone else aspects of their identity.
Things like their relationships, the development of its physical capabilities -- their studies and other ways they start to suffer.
Six of every 10 girls would rather not do something because they think they don't see good enough.
These are not <unk>
They are fundamental activities for its growth as human beings and as <unk> to society and to the developing field.
And 31 percent, almost one of three teenagers are not interested in the classroom of class.
One out of five are not attending classes at all, when you don't feel comfortable about it.
And in the tests, if you don't think you see you good enough, specifically if you don't think you're sufficiently thin, you will give you a lower note to the average of your peers who don't care about what it looks like.
And this phenomenon has widespread in Finland, the United States and China, in China.
And it takes care of what they actually weigh these young.
So in order to be clear, we're talking about how you see you, not how you really are.
The low self-esteem over its body is <unk> the academic performance.
And it's also <unk> health.
<unk> with little self-esteem are doing less physical activity, they eat less fruits and vegetables, they participate in more diet that you can take them to a food disorder.
They have low self-esteem.
They're more easily <unk> by the people around them and are at greater risk of depression.
And we think that this is all because of all of this because they make alcohol decisions like alcohol and drugs, diet and aesthetic surgery, aesthetic sexual relationships to early ages and no protection and damage damage.
The perfect body search is pushing the health system, and our government costs billions of dollars every year.
And we're not <unk>
Women who believe they have overweight again, regardless of whether they have or don't have higher rates of <unk>
The 17 percent of women are not presented to a job interview in one day where they don't feel safe with the way you see them.
Think for a moment in what this is doing to our economy.
If we could overcome this, what would that be <unk>
<unk> this potential is for each of us.
But how do we do that?
Well, speaking, it doesn't take you very far.
Not enough.
If you really want to change things, you have to do something.
And we've learned that there are three key <unk> The first one is we have to instill trust in their own body.
We need to help our teenagers to develop strategies to overcome the pressure of perfect images and build their self-esteem.
The good news is that there are many programs available to do that.
The bad news is that most of these don't work.
I was really surprised when I learned that a lot of <unk> programs without realizing it, <unk> the situation.
So we should make sure that the program that our children follow our children will not only have a positive impact but also an unsustainable impact.
And research studies show that the best programs are focused on six key areas. The first is the influence of family, friends and relationships.
These six ways are starting to be crucial points for anyone who is willing to provide education into body self-esteem that work.
An education is fundamental but facing this problem requires each of us to take the reins on the issue and be a better model to follow for women and girls in our own lives.
I defy the current status of how women are <unk> and I mentioned in our circles.
It's not good to tell you about the input of our political <unk> or the size of your <unk> or the size of your <unk> or the success of a Olympic athlete depends on the fact that it's not a great beauty.
We need to begin to judge people for what they are, not as you can see.
So all of us can start doing doing this, assuming the responsibility for the kind of images and the comments we published in our social networks.
We can engage people based on their effort and their actions and not on their appearance.
And let me ask you. When was the last time you <unk> a <unk>
In short, we need to work together as communities, like governments and like companies, to truly change our culture, so that our children grow to grow their entire person, valuing the individuality, the diversity, the <unk>
We need to put people who are really making the difference in a <unk>
It's going to make a difference in the real world, let's make them be the ones that come out on the big screen because we just create a different world.
A world where our children are free to become the best version of them -- where the way they believe that they see that they see that they see people who are, or to achieve what they want in their lives.
Think about what this can mean for someone in your lives.
Who do you have in your mind?
His <unk>
His <unk>
His <unk>
His <unk> A <unk>
It could simply be the woman who is two car seats -- what would it mean for her if he was liberated from that voice and she would be released from that <unk> voice in his interior, which was <unk> by no longer a long legs, more skinny, a more flat belly -- a <unk> feet.
What would it mean for her if we were to try to do this, and we would say it leads to his potential in that way?
Right now, the obsession of our culture with images is holding us all together.
But let's tell our children the truth.
You know, the way you see you are just a part of your identity, and that the truth is that we love them for those who are and what they do, and because they make us feel.
It will lead to self-esteem in the <unk> of our schools.
Let's change each of us, the way we talk about and compare to other people.
And <unk> together as a community, from small groups to governments, so that the small <unk> of a year of age today, they become law agents of themselves tomorrow.
So let's do it.
The five of November of 1990, a man named <unk> <unk> walked into a hotel in Manhattan and killed the <unk> rabbi leader of the League of Defense <unk>
<unk> initially was the innocent man, but being a prisoner for other minor charges in the company of others, started planning with attacks in New York, including <unk> <unk> and the U.N.
Fortunately, those plans were transferred by an informant from the FBI.
Sadly, the bomb.
<unk> <unk> would be convicted of their participation in that <unk>
<unk> <unk> is my father.
I was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in 1983, being an engineer <unk> with a loving mother, an American school master -- among the two were made all the possible for giving me a happy hair.
Only when I was seven years old, our family started to change.
My father taught me a form of Islam, that very few, even most Muslims come to meet.
And I saw that when people take time to interact, it doesn't need a lot to communicate the same things in life.
However, in all religion, in all of religion, there is always a small fraction of people who were so <unk> to their convictions who think that we need to use all the possible means for everybody to live as them.
A few months before arrest him, he sat with me and explained to me that in the last week, he and some friends, had been going to run by shot in Long Island, to practice.
He told me that I would go with him the next day.
We got to the shot <unk> <unk> which, without knowing our group, I was punished by the FBI.
When I touched my father -- my father helped me hold the <unk> on the shoulder, and he explained to me how to point to about 30 meters.
That day, with the last bullet he shot him gave to the little orange light on the goal and to surprise everybody, especially mine, all the goal broke on fire.
My uncle became the other and in Arabic, said <unk> <unk>
From such a parent, such a child.
All of all, the comment really made them a lot of laugh, but only a few years later I understood what they were so funny.
Did you see in me, the same level of destruction that my father might be <unk>
Those people later would be condemned to put a van <unk> with 700 pounds of explosives in the underground tower in the World tower of the World Trade Center, causing a explosion that killed six people and sentenced to other 1,000.
I admired those men.
He called them <unk> which means uncle.
When I turned 19, I had moved me 20 times. That instability during my childhood didn't allow me to make a lot of friendships.
Every time I started feeling comfortable close to someone already was time to pack and go to another city.
As I was always my new face of the class of <unk>
<unk> secret -- my identity to avoid being the whites -- but it will be the new of the class, silent and <unk> was enough <unk>
So most of the time I was going on home by reading books, watching television or playing video games.
For these reasons I did not develop social skills, to put it <unk> to grow under <unk> I wasn't prepared for the real world.
I grew opera to judge people, based on indicators of indicators like their race or their religion.
So how could I open the eyes?
And one of the first experiences that they put to test my way to think about it, was during the presidential election of 2000.
In a <unk> program I participated in the <unk> National Convention in Philadelphia.
My group stood up in the subject of juvenile violence -- as I had been known to <unk> most of my life, was something that I felt a lot of passion.
The members of this group came from various <unk>
One day, towards the end of the <unk> I discovered that one of the kids we had done friendships, was Jewish people.
I took a number of days out of light, this detail and realized that there was no <unk> between the two.
I had never had a Jewish friend and frankly I felt very proud of having been able to overcome the barrier that all of life had made me believe that it was <unk>
Another crucial moment emerged when I got a summer job in Bush <unk> an amusement park.
I found myself with people from all kinds of beliefs and cultures. That experience was fundamental to the development of my character.
All of the life had taught me that <unk> was a sin and by extension, all gay people were bad <unk>
I happened to have the opportunity to work with gay actors there, in an show, and I could see that several of them were the kinder and less critics who had seen in life.
Having been a <unk> I developed a sense of empathy towards the suffering of others, but it wasn't easy for me to treat kind, and exactly how I would have to be treated.
For that feeling I was able to contrast the stereotypes that had taught me as a child, with the experience of interaction in real life.
I don't know what it is to be homosexual but I know what it is to be judged by something beyond my control.
Then came the <unk> <unk>
Every night, Jon Stewart made me kind of honest about my <unk> and I was helping me see that race of people, religion or sexual orientation, you have nothing to do with character.
In many ways he became my <unk> <unk> at a moment that I was desperately <unk>
Sometimes the inspiration can come from the unexpected. And a Jewish comedian would have had a better influence in my life than my own father, <unk> was not in vain.
I had a conversation with my mother on how I was changing my way to think, and she told me something that keeps my heart forever, while he's alive.
She looked at me with the eyes tired of someone who has suffered enough <unk> and he said, "I'm tired of <unk>
At that time, I realized how much negative energy you need to keep all that hate in your inside.
My real name is not <unk> <unk>
It changed when my family decided to break the relationship with my father and start a new life.
So why did I decided to go out and put a possible risk?
Well, it's simple.
I've done it because I hope that someone, one day, who is to take the violence, I can hear my story and understand that there is a better way to be able to get to this violent ideology and <unk> I didn't get to make me <unk>
On the contrary, I decided to use my experience to fight terrorism and against prejudice.
I do it by the <unk> of terrorism and because of their loved ones, because terrorism has been produced in their lives.
For the victims of terrorism -- to talk about those meaningless acts as rejection of my father's actions.
With this simplicity -- I put myself here as proof that violence is not inherent to religion or race, which kids don't have to follow the roads of their parents.
I'm not my father.
Thank you.  Thank you all.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.
At this point, there's a film that projects in your minds.
It's an incredible movie film.
It's in 3D and it has <unk> sound of what you hear and see right now. But that's just the beginning.
Your movie has smell and texture.
It feels your body, your pain, your pleasure.
It has emotions, anger and happiness.
It has memories, like moments of your childhood that you project into your eyes.
And there's constantly voice superimposed on your conscious thought.
The heart of the movie is you who experience everything directly.
This movie is your flow of consciousness, the subject of the mind and the world.
Consciousness is one of the fundamental truths about the existence of the human being.
Each of us are conscious.
We all have an internal film, you, you and you.
There's nothing we know more directly.
At least I know I have a real consciousness.
I'm not sure you are conscious.
Consciousness is also the reason for living.
If we were not aware of this, nothing in our lives would make sense or value.
But at the same time is the most mysterious phenomenon of the universe.
Why are we <unk>
Why do we have these horror movies.
Why are we not just robots that we <unk> what we get to produce without experiencing the movie <unk>
At this moment, nobody knows the answers to those questions.
I suggest that to integrate consciousness to science, you need some radical ideas.
Some people say it's impossible a science of consciousness.
Science of science, is objective by nature.
<unk> by nature, is subjective disease.
So there's never a science of consciousness.
Because most of the 20th century, that vision.
psychology was studying <unk> behavior, the neuroscience was studying the brain, but never nobody mentioned consciousness.
Even 30 years ago, when TED started, there were very few scientists about consciousness.
<unk> 20 years ago, everything started to change.
It was like Francis Crick and physicists like Roger <unk> said, <unk> is the moment for science to <unk> <unk>
And since then, there was a real bang, a <unk> of the scientific work of consciousness.
And this was fantastic. It was great.
But it also has fundamental limitations to the moment.
The center of consciousness in the recent years was the search for <unk> correlations between some areas of the brain and some states of consciousness.
We saw something about this kind of fantastic work I presented Nancy <unk> a few minutes ago.
We now understand much better, for example, areas of the brain that are related to the conscious experience of seeing faces or feeling pain or feeling happy.
But this is still a science of <unk>
It's not a science of <unk>
We know that these areas of the brain are related to certain kinds of emotional experiences, but we don't know why.
I'd like to explain to me by saying that this kind of work of neuroscience responds to some questions that we want to explain consciousness -- the questions about what certain areas of brain are and what they <unk>
But in a sense, those are the easy problems.
<unk> <unk>
Actually, there's no easy problem with consciousness.
Well, it's not tackles the real mystery of this <unk> why all the physical process in the brain has to be accompanied by consciousness?
Why is there an internal movie <unk>
At this moment, we can't understand it.
And you can say, let's give it a few years to the neuroscience.
It's going to become another emerging phenomenon, like <unk> like life, and we're going to find explanation.
The typical <unk> are all cases of emerging behaviors, how they operate <unk> how they work <unk> how they adapt and adapt to the living organisms, all these are questions about how objective works.
That could be applied to the human brain to explain some behaviors and the functions of the human brain as a <unk> phenomenon, how we talk, how we speak, how we speak, how we speak, all of them are questions about behavior.
But when it comes to consciousness, the questions about behavior are between the easy problems.
But the hard problem is the question why is that all behavior is accompanied by an <unk> experience.
And here it is, the standard paradigm of the <unk> the standard paradigm of neuroscience, in fact, still doesn't have a lot to say.
I'm a <unk> <unk>
I want a scientific theory of <unk> which works for a long time, I was beating my head against the wall looking for a theory of consciousness in pure terms that would work.
But at the end I came to the conclusion that it didn't work for reasons for me.
I think we get rid of this point.
We have a chain of wonderful explanation, and we get used to this -- the physics explains the chemistry, the chemistry explains biology, biology explains part of psychology.
But consciousness doesn't seem to fit in this scheme.
On the one hand, it's a fact that we are conscious.
For another, we don't know how to accommodate that idea of our scientific view of the world.
I think that consciousness, I think that consciousness, is sort of <unk> something that we need to integrate our worldview, but we don't know even how.
With an anomaly like this, you can need radical ideas, I think we need some ideas that at the beginning of <unk> crazy things before we can deal with consciousness in a scientific way.
There are some possibilities for those crazy ideas.
My friend Dan Dennett, which is here today, has one.
His crazy idea is that there isn't such a difficult problem of consciousness.
The whole idea of the internal subjective movie includes a kind of illusion or confusion.
In fact, what you have to do, is to explain the <unk> functions the behaviors of the brain, and then you study everything that needs explanation.
Well, more power for him.
That's the kind of radical idea that we need to explore if we want to have a purely <unk> theory based on the brain.
At the same time, for me and for many others, that vision is pretty close to simply denying the observation of consciousness is <unk>
But I'm in a different direction.
In the time, I want to explore two crazy ideas that I think can be <unk>
The first crazy idea is that consciousness is critical.
<unk> sometimes take some aspects of the universe as bricks and core space, time and mass.
The fundamental laws of laws like the laws of gravity or quantum mechanics.
These laws and fundamental properties don't explain in terms of anything else.
Instead, they look interesting, and it's built in the world.
Sometimes, the list of the fundamental <unk>
In the 19th century, <unk> <unk> that you can't explain the electromagnetic phenomena in terms of <unk> fundamental concepts -- space, time, mass, laws of Newton. And then applied the basic laws of the <unk> and applied electric charge as a fundamental concept that those laws are <unk>
I think that's the situation we find with consciousness.
If you can't explain consciousness in terms of fundamental ideas -- space, time, mass, no mass, then the <unk>
The most natural thing would be <unk> as a primal thing, a fundamental brick of nature.
This doesn't mean that it is suddenly not the object of the sciences.
It opens the path to <unk> scientifically.
So what we need is to study the fundamental laws that govern consciousness, the laws that connect consciousness with other core concepts -- space space, the mass, the <unk>
The physicists sometimes say that we want fundamental laws so simple that we can put them into a <unk>
The situation of consciousness is something like this.
We want to find fundamental laws so simple that we can put them in a t-shirt.
We still don't know what laws are, but that's what the laws are.
The second crazy idea is that consciousness can be universal.
Every system can have a degree of consciousness.
This vision is sometimes called <unk> <unk> by everyone, <unk> in mind, every system is conscious, not only humans, dogs mice, flies, even the microbes from Rob <unk> the elementary particles.
Even a <unk> has some degree of consciousness.
The idea is not that photons are smart or <unk>
It's not that a <unk> can be full of distress when you think about me, "Oh, always traveling at the speed of light.
I can never slow down and smell <unk>
No, no.
But the thought is that perhaps photons can have some sense of meaningless <unk> subjective.
This may sound a little crazy for you.
How did anyone think something so crazy?
And in part of this comes from the first crazy idea, that consciousness is a fundamental thing.
If it's fundamental as space, time and mass, it's natural to assume that it can also be universal, like others.
It's also worth noticing that although the idea is <unk> it's much less for the people of different cultures, where the human mind seems more a continuum with nature.
A deeper reason comes from the idea that perhaps the simplest and powerful way of finding fundamental laws of finding the thought with the physical process, is <unk> consciousness with information.
Whenever there are information processing -- there's awareness.
<unk> complex <unk> like a human being, consciousness in a human being.
<unk> simple information, simple awareness.
Something really exciting is that in the recent years a neuroscientist, <unk> <unk> took this kind of theory, and I developed it with mathematicians.
It has an mathematical measure of information integration, which is called <unk> which measures the degree of information integrated into a system.
And it's supposed to do with consciousness.
So in a human brain, there's an incredible degree of information integration, a high degree of <unk> a lot of consciousness.
In a mouse is a degree of information integration, just quite significant, degree of consciousness quite important.
But when you get to the worms, microbes, the degree of <unk> <unk>
The level of information integration is smaller, but it's not zero either.
In <unk> theory, there will still be a different level of consciousness.
In fact, providing a fundamental law of <unk> high degree of consciousness.
Moreover, another reason is that <unk> can help us integrate consciousness into the physical world.
physicists and philosophers have often observed that physics is curiously abstract.
We have the structure of reality using a lot of equations, but we don't talk about the reality that underlies underneath.
As explains Stephen Hawking, where does the fire <unk>
From <unk> vision, the equations of physics can be left as they are, but you can use to describe the flow of consciousness.
That's what physicists do basically describe the flow of consciousness.
According to this vision, the awareness is the one that puts fire at the equations.
In that vision, consciousness is not outside of the physical world as a kind of <unk>
It's right there in the center.
This vision -- I think, <unk> vision has the potential to solve our relationship with nature, and it can have very serious social and ethical and ethical consequences.
Some can be <unk>
I used to think that I should not eat anything to have consciousness, so I had to be a <unk>
If you're a <unk> and you accept that vision, you'll have lots of starving.
I think it tends to do this tends to transform your dreams, while what matters in ethical terms and moral <unk> is not so much the fact of consciousness, but its importance and complexity.
It's also natural to ask for consciousness in other systems, like computers.
What about the artificial intelligence system in Samantha <unk>
It's <unk>
According to the vision of information -- she has a complicated information processing that the answer is yes, if you're conscious.
If this is right now, they have a fairly serious ethical problems about the ethics of intelligent computers and the ethics of <unk>
Finally, you can ask for consciousness of collective consciousness -- the planet.
Canada has their own consciousness?
Or a more local level, a group integrated as the audience in a TED Talk, right now, we have a TED conscience -- an internal movie for this full TED group, different from the inner movies of each other.
I don't know the answer to that question, but I think at least it's a question that you should really take seriously.
So this <unk> <unk> is a radical vision, and I don't know if it's correct.
Actually, I'm more sure of the first crazy idea, that consciousness is a fundamental thing, which is universal than the second crazy idea.
So vision raises many questions, a lot of challenges, like, how those bits of thinking contribute to the kind of complex consciousness that we know and love it.
If we can answer those questions, then I think we're going on the right path towards a theory of serious awareness.
If not, well, it's probably the most difficult problem for science and philosophy.
We can't wait for the night to the morning.
But I think we will finally find it.
To understand consciousness is the real key, I think, to understand the universe and understand ourselves.
Maybe we just need the crazy idea.
Thank you.
I grew up in a small rural village at all.
I had a very normal profile.
I went to school, I met with my friends, my younger sisters.
Everything was very normal.
And when I was 15 years old, a member of my community came up to my parents because I wanted to <unk> for a community prize.
And my parents said, "Well, that's really nice, but there's a clear problem.
She actually has nothing."
I went to school, I had good grades. After school, I had a under profile in the <unk> of my mother, and I spent a lot of time watching the <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
Yeah, yes. <unk> <unk>
But they were right.
I did nothing that was extraordinary at all.
Nothing that you can consider as a win if we take the disability out of the equation.
Many years later, I was in the second part of teaching high school school in high school school as only about 20 minutes in the middle class of studies, a boy raised her hand and said, "Hey, when give you your <unk>
And I said, "What do you do?"
Well, I had been talking about the law of <unk> for about good minutes.
And he said, "You know, your <unk> speech.
When people on chairs of wheels, they talk about <unk> things at school?"
<unk> in the classroom.
And it was then when I realized, this child had had experiences with disability as <unk> objects.
And we are. And it's not the <unk> I mean, that's true for many of us.
For us, people with disability are not our teachers or our doctors or our <unk>
We are not real people. We're there for <unk>
And in fact, I'm on this stage where I do in this wheelchair, and you probably are waiting for you. Right?  Yeah.
Well, ladies and gentlemen, I'm afraid of <unk> <unk>
I'm not here for <unk>
I'm here to tell you that they've lied to us in relation to disability.
Yes, it has been sold for us the lie that disability is something <unk> A capital <unk>
It's something wrong and living with a disability with disability for you.
It's not a bad thing, and it doesn't get to make you exceptional.
And in the last few years, we've been able to spread even more this lie through social media.
You may have seen images like this: "The only disability in life is a bad <unk>
Or this <unk> "Your excuse is <unk>
Or this <unk> "Before <unk> <unk>
These are just a couple of examples, but there is a lot of them.
You may have seen one, of the girl without the hands of drawing with a pencil holding out of the mouth.
You may have seen a child running with carbon fiber <unk>
And there's a lot of these images, which are what we call <unk>
And I use the porn porn term -- because we get a group of people for the benefit of another group of people.
So in this case, we will encourage the disability in the benefit of people with no disability.
The purpose of these images is <unk> <unk> so we can see them and think, "Well, for very bad than my life, it might be worse.
I could be that person."
But if you are that person?
I've lost the number of times the number of times I've been dealing with weird <unk> to say that you believe that I am brave or a source of inspiration, and this was going to happen before my work had a public profile.
It was kind of like me to get up in the morning and remember my own name.  And this is <unk>
These images, those images, those images are attributed to people with disability with people with no disability.
They're there for you to look at them and think that things aren't such as bad for you, or to put their concerns in perspective.
And life as a disabled person is actually a difficult thing.
I think of some things.
But the things that we have is not the things you can think.
They're not relative to our bodies.
I use the term <unk> <unk> deliberately because I <unk> the so-called social model of <unk> which tells us that we're more disability because of the society that we live from because of our bodies or diagnostics.
So I've lived in this body for a long time.
I'm very pleased with him.
So what I need to do, and I've learned to get the best of your capacity as you do, and that's what happens with the kids of those pictures as well.
They're not doing anything outside the commons.
They're simply using their bodies by getting the best of their ability.
So it's really just <unk> in the way we do it, to share those <unk>
When people say, "You're a source of <unk> it says it as a compliment.
And I know why that happens.
It's because of the lie, because they've been sold to this lie that disability makes us <unk>
And honestly, he doesn't do it.
And I know what you're thinking.
I'm here <unk> inspiration -- and you think, "Oh God, <unk> you're not sometimes inspired by anything?"
And actually, I know I am.
<unk> of other people with disability at all time.
However, I don't know that I'm younger than them.
<unk> that this is a great idea to use a <unk> <unk> to pick up the things that fall around me --  -- <unk> the ingenious trick of how to charge your cell phone on your chair.
Great.
We learn from the force and resistance of others, not against our bodies and our <unk> but against a world that <unk> and <unk>
I really believe that that lie that have sold us about disability is the biggest <unk>
It makes us the hard life.
And that <unk> "The only disability in life is a bad <unk> the reason that that's lie because it's not true because of the social model of disability.
A lot of smiles in the stairs has not made it to become a <unk>
Never.    You know, to a television screen will not make the subtitles.
Not a whole bunch of people in the middle of a <unk> and <unk> a positive attitude to convert all those books to the <unk>
It's just not going to happen.
I really want to live in a world where disability is not the exception, but the norm.
I want to live where a 15 year-old girl sitting in his bedroom watching <unk> the <unk> <unk> is not considered <unk> of nothing for being in a chair.
I want to live in a world where we don't have so low expectations of people with disability that we are <unk> to wake up from the bed and remember our names for the morning.
I want to live in a world where we value the genuine achievement of people with disabilities, and I want to live in a world where a child at 11 grade school is not a little bit surprised that his new teacher is a <unk> user <unk>
<unk> does not make us, but question what you think to know about it about it.
Thank you.
What do you have to see augmented reality and the professional <unk> with <unk>
And what is the average speed of <unk> <unk>
Unfortunately, today just answering one of those questions, so please, not <unk>
When people think actually <unk> they think about <unk> <unk> and Tom <unk> <unk> the hands in the air, but augmented reality is not science fiction.
<unk> reality is something that will happen in our days and happen because we have the tools for it, and people need to know, because augmented reality will change our lives as much as the Internet and mobile phones.
So how did we get to the reality <unk>
The first step, is what I wear <unk> Google Glass.
I'm sure many of you are familiar with them.
What you may not know is that Google <unk> are a device that lets you see what I see.
It will allow you to experience what's going to be a professional <unk> in the field.
Right now, the only way to be in the field is that I try <unk>
I have to use words.
I have to create a framework that you <unk> with your imagination.
We can use Google Glass, underneath a helmet and know what is running through the game to 160 <unk> the blood hitting the ears.
We can know that a <unk> man feels like a <unk> trying to do it with everything to be.
I've been there and I assure you, it's not nice.
Some videos to show you what is to use Google <unk> under the helmet, and give you an idea of that.
Unfortunately, it's not images of <unk> practices because the idea of the <unk> technology is a submarine up to the surface. But we do what we can.
So let's look at a video.
Chris <unk> Come on.
It's horrible to be <unk>
<unk> <unk> a little bit.
<unk>
Go!
Chris <unk> As you can see, it's a <unk> of what's going to be <unk> in the football field, from the perspective of <unk>
You may have realized that we lack people, the rest of the team.
We have a video of them, <unk> from the University of Washington.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Blue Mission Blue <unk> Go!
Chris <unk> This is a little bit more about feeling being in the field, but it has nothing to do with being in the <unk>
<unk> want that experience.
<unk> want to be in the field, will be their favorite players and have asked me on YouTube and <unk> "You can see from the angle of a <unk>
Or about a <unk>
We want to experience that."
Once we have that experience with <unk> and Google Glass, how do we go from <unk> how do we take it to the next <unk>
We take it at that level using something called <unk> <unk> that probably many people already know.
The Rift <unk> has been described as the most realistic virtual reality apparatus ever created, and it's not cheap.
And I'm going to show you why, with this video.
Man: Oh, Oh.
No, no, no, no, I don't want to keep <unk> No!
Oh, my God! Ah!
<unk> That's the experience of a man in a roller coaster of his life.
What will be the experience of a fan of a fan when we <unk> a video of Adrian <unk> crossing the line, <unk> from a <unk> with the arm before I run and doing a <unk> What will be the experience of a fan of a fan of a fan.
When I can be <unk> running by the <unk> launching the ball into the background of the network? Or would you take a stick in <unk>
What will be your experience when you go from a mountain to more than 100 miles an hour as a <unk> <unk>
Maybe it was <unk> the sales of diapers for adults.
But this is not yet <unk>
It's just virtual reality.
How do we get to reality <unk> <unk>
<unk> augmented reality when <unk> and owners see the information that people want to see and think, "How do we use this to improve our <unk>
How do we use it to win <unk>
Because they always use technology to win.
They like to win. It gives you money.
So, here's a quick review of technology in the <unk>
In 1965, the <unk> of Baltimore put him into a <unk> to his <unk> and he would play faster.
They won the Super Bowl that year.
Other teams decided to <unk>
More people saw the game because it was more exciting, more fast.
In 1994, the <unk> I put on the <unk> of the <unk> and then the <unk>
They had more viewers because it was faster, more entertaining.
In <unk> imagine that you are a player coming back to your group, and you see her next move shown in front of you, in a plastic bombsight that you wear on. You don't have to worry about forgetting a <unk>
Or for the strategy.
They just go into the field and <unk>
And the coaches want it, because if they don't follow their instructions, they lose games, and they hate losing <unk>
If you lose games as a coach.
And they don't want that.
But augmented reality is not just a manual <unk>
<unk> reality is also a way to gather information and use it in real time to improve your game in the form of playing the game.
How do you do it?
Well, a very simple option would be having a camera in every corner of the stadium having a view from the high people on the bottom.
You also get information from the <unk> sensors and the <unk> something that is already working on.
And all that information is send you to your <unk>
The good teams will know <unk>
The bad will have <unk>
This is going to make the good teams of bad guys.
So your computer team will be as important as your <unk> and the data analysis will stop being <unk>
It will also be <unk> Who would have <unk>
How would it be in the country?
Imagine that they're the field <unk>
Let's take the ball and <unk>
<unk> an open receiver -- all of a sudden, a <unk> on the left of your bombsight -- you would remind you that a defense behind you is going to <unk> Usually not <unk> but the <unk> system, you get <unk>
It was going to be the protection.
Another <unk> <unk> that there's an open <unk>
<unk> the <unk> but you <unk>
And the ball loses the trajectory.
You don't know where it lands, though, the receptor sees its bombsight a patch of grass and it can change the race.
He <unk> <unk> <unk> running and <unk>
The public is going on and the fans have followed the move from every angle.
This is something that creates massive emotion.
So I'm going to get lots of people to see it, because people want to live that experience.
<unk> want to be in the ground.
They want to be your favorite player.
<unk> reality will be part of sports because it's too profitable to not be.
But what I ask you is, we want this to be the only use of reality <unk>
Let's use it just as bread and <unk> like our <unk> entertainment.
Because I think we can use it for something else.
I think we can use augmented reality to foster the empathy between human beings, to show someone what is literally being in the other person's place.
We know what this technology is worth of <unk>
It generates billions of income a year.
But how much is this technology for a professor in the classroom trying to show a <unk> how bad are your actions from the perspective of <unk>
How much is this technology for a gay people in Uganda or Russia trying to show the world how it's living <unk>
How much is it as well as a <unk> or a Neil <unk> <unk> trying to inspire a generation of kids to think more about space and science rather than <unk> notes and <unk>
Ladies and gentlemen, the augmented reality is coming.
The questions that we do, the decisions we take and the challenges we face -- <unk> as always, from us.
Thank you.
I recently signed up after 23 years of service in the <unk> <unk> of California.
Most of those 23 years -- the <unk> end of Lofa County, which includes the bridge <unk> <unk>
The bridge is a <unk> structure, known for its beautiful view of San Francisco, the Pacific Ocean and its architectural inspirational style.
Unfortunately, it's also a magnet for suicide being one of the most used places in the world.
The Golden <unk> Bridge was opened in <unk>
Joseph <unk> engineer trying to build the bridge, said that, "The bridge is pretty much proof of <unk>
<unk> from the bridge is not practical or <unk>
But from its openness, over 1,600 people have jumped to their death from that bridge.
Some people believe that travel between the two towers to take on another dimension, this bridge has <unk> as such, so every one from it, you remind you from all your concerns and pain, and the waters that go under <unk> your soul.
But let me tell you that happens when the bridge is used for committing suicide.
After a <unk> every single <unk> body hits water about 120 miles an hour.
The impact on the heat of bone, some of which are going to create vital organs.
Most people die in impact.
The ones that no, they usually fall into the <unk> water, and then they <unk>
I don't think that the suicide <unk> will realize the death of death to which they <unk>
This is the wire.
Except about the two towers, there are 32 inches of parallel parallel to the bridge.
This is where most people have to get out of life.
I can tell you by experience that once the person is on that edge, and at the darker time, it's very difficult to bring them back back.
I took this picture last year while this young girl spoke with an officer watching his life.
I want to tell you with joy that we had a successful day to bring it back over the <unk>
When I started working on the bridge, we didn't have any formal training.
<unk> to channel the path through these calls.
This was not just a bad service to those who <unk> suicide, they were the officers as well.
We've come a long way since then.
Today, veterans and psychologists trained the new official ones.
This is Jason <unk>
I met him at the July 22, last year when he got a call from a suicide bomber sitting in the <unk> <unk>
<unk> and when I got there, he looked at Jason talking to a <unk> <unk> <unk>
Jason had only 32 years and had flown up to here from New Jersey.
In fact, it had flown up here two times before New Jersey to try to commit suicide from this bridge.
After about an hour talking to <unk> we asked us if we knew the story of the box of <unk>
<unk> the mythology <unk> <unk> created <unk> and sent to the Earth with a box, and he said, <unk> never open that <unk>
Well, one day, curiosity could be more than <unk> and she opened the box.
And she came out <unk> <unk> and all sorts of <unk> against man.
The only good thing in the box was hope.
So Jason he said, "What if you open the box and there's no <unk>
He stopped a few <unk> leaned on the right, and he did.
This kind and smart boy from New Jersey had just taken his life.
I talked to the parents of Jason that night, and I guess when I was talking to them, it didn't seem to be ringing very well, because the next day, the rabbi rabbi was called me to see how I was.
The parents of Jason had been asking him.
The damage from suicide affects a lot of people.
I give you these questions: What would you do if a member of your family or a friend or someone loved them were <unk>
What do we find?
What do we say?
In my experience, it's not only to talk, but you have to hear.
You hear to understand.
Not <unk> <unk> or say to the person who you know how it feels like it, because you probably don't know.
Just be there, you can be the tipping point that you need.
If you think that somebody is <unk> not having fear of <unk> and asking the question.
One way to ask you the question is: <unk> at similar circumstances have thought to finish their life, you've had these <unk>
They put the person in front of her life and save the life point for them.
Other signs to <unk> despair, believe that things are terrible and they never go to <unk> <unk> believe that there is nothing you can do to the <unk> social isolation and a losing interest in life.
I came up with this talk just a couple of days ago, and I got an email from a lady and I'd like to read you your letter.
She lost his son on the 19th of January of this year, and he wrote this email just a couple days ago, and it's with her permission and <unk> I read it.
"Hello, <unk> I guess you're at the TED conference.
It must be a whole experience there.
I'm thinking that I should go up to the bridge this weekend.
I just wanted to leave you a note.
I hope you can tell a lot of people and go home talking about it to your friends who tell your friends, and so on.
I'm still pretty <unk> but noticing the more moments of realizing that Mike won't go home.
Mike was driving from <unk> to San Francisco to see the <unk> party with his father the 19 of January.
It never came there.
I called the police <unk> and they would take it like disappeared that night.
The next morning, two officers came to my home and reported that the <unk> car was down in the bridge.
A witness had seen him jump from the bridge to the <unk> of the day before.
Thank you very much for fighting for those who can be temporarily too weak to fight themselves.
Who hasn't been wrong with a real heart disease.
It shouldn't be so easy to end up with it.
My prayers are with you for your fight.
The <unk> <unk> Bridge is supposed to be a passage through our beautiful, <unk> <unk>
Good luck this week, <unk>
I can't imagine the value that she needed to go to the bridge and walk the way his son took that day, and also the value to go ahead.
I would like to introduce you to a man who refer to hope and value.
On March March of March 2005, I wrote a call for a <unk> who was a suicide bomber on the sidewalk near the north.
I took my bike. I watched this man, Kevin <unk> standing on the sidewalk.
When he looked at me immediately the <unk> and he stopped in that little tube that goes around the tower.
For the time and the next, I heard as Kevin talked about her depression and despair.
And Kevin decided to get her back back over that lane and give life another opportunity.
When Kevin <unk> it <unk>
"This is a new beginning, a new life."
But I asked him, "What was the thing that made it <unk> and he gave the hope and life again.
And you know what he told me?
He said, "I <unk>
I was left to speak and just <unk>
Shortly after that incident, I got a letter from the mother and Kevin, and I have that letter with me, and I'd like to give you to you.
"Dear Mr. <unk> Nothing erase the 11th events of March, and you're one of the reasons why Kevin remains with us.
Honestly, I think Kevin was <unk> for help.
It's been diagnosed with a mental illness for which it was properly <unk>
<unk> to Kevin when I only had six months, completely unconscious of all of those traits -- but thank God, we now know.
Kevin is in order, as the <unk>
We give God for you.
<unk> in debt with you, <unk> <unk>
And at the end, she wrote, <unk> When I visited General General at San Francisco at the night, you would wake up as the patient.
<unk> I did have it <unk>
Today, Kevin is a <unk> father of society.
Talk openly about the events of that day and their depression with the hope that their story inspire others.
<unk> is not just something I've been found at work.
It's personal.
My grandfather killed himself with poison.
That act, in spite of finishing their own pain, theft is a chance to meet him.
This is what suicide.
For most people <unk> or those who consider suicide, they wouldn't think hurt someone else.
They simply want their own chest pain.
Typically, this is accomplished by three things: sleep, drugs or alcohol or death.
In my career, I have responded and I've been involved in hundreds of mental illness and suicide calls around the bridge.
Of those incidents that I've been directly involved in, I've only lost two, but those two are too much.
One was <unk>
The other one was a man who talked about about an hour.
And during that time, I took my hand at three times.
In the end, I looked at me, and he said, <unk> I'm sorry, but I have to go."
And <unk>
It was absolutely horrible.
I want to tell you, though, that the vast majority of the people we get to contact with that bridge not <unk>
Moreover, those few who have jumped from the bridge and lived and that you can talk about it, that one percent or <unk> most of those people have said that the second one who leaves the railing on the railing realized they had made a mistake and they wanted to live.
I tell people, the bridge doesn't just connect us with San Francisco, but also people.
That connection, or a bridge that we do, is something that every single one of us should be able to do to do.
<unk> can prevent.
There are help. There's hope.
Thank you very much.
The world makes you be what you don't are, but in your inside you know what you are, and a question asks you, how do you become that?
I must be something unique in that sense, but I'm not alone in any way I'm alone.
When I became a model that I felt that I had achieved the dream that I had since a child.
My outside finally <unk> with my inner truth, with my inner self.
For the reasons why I go back later, when I look at this picture, and I think, I think, is you going to have it, you know, <unk> it <unk>
But last October, I discovered that, <unk> I'm beginning.
We are all excited about our families, our religion, our society, our moment in history, even our bodies.
Some of them have the value of <unk> to get rid of the limitations of the color of the skin or by the beliefs of those around us.
These are people who always challenge the status quo -- what's considered <unk>
In my case, the last nine years -- many of my neighbors, many of my friends, my agent even ignored my story.
I think this <unk> is called <unk>
This is mine.
I was recorded as <unk> at birth because of my <unk>
I remember my five years in the Philippines, in my house, I was always wearing this t-shirt on the head.
And my mom wondered, "Why are you always wearing that t-shirt in the <unk>
I said, "Mom, it's my hair. I'm a <unk>
I knew then how to do it <unk>
The gender has always been considered a <unk> but now we know that, actually, it's something more complex and mystery now.
Because of my success, I will never help me share my story, not because I thought that will be what I'm bad, but because of how the world comes to those of us who want to <unk>
Every day I appreciate being a woman.
I am mom, Dad and a family who gets me as I am.
Many are not so fortunate.
There's a long tradition in <unk> culture that celebrates the mystery of gender.
There's a Buddhist god.
There's a <unk> goddess of <unk>
And when I was eight years old, I was at a party in the Philippines who celebrated these puzzles.
I was in front of the stage and I remember that this beautiful woman appeared in front of me, and I remember that moment as if something happened to me, this is the kind of woman I want to be.
And when I was 15, when I was 15 years old, I met this woman called <unk>
It's the director of a <unk> beauty competition.
That night she asked me, "Why haven't you been involved in the <unk> competition.
He told me that if I was <unk> she was over the <unk> and the <unk> and that night, I won in a bathroom I won in <unk> and I got a third <unk> between over 40 candidate candidates.
That moment changed my life.
Suddenly, I was inside the world of beauty.
Not a lot of people can say that their first job was of Queen of <unk> women, but I can.
I also met the goddess of <unk> especially when I went to the remote provinces of the <unk>
But more importantly, I met my best friends in that community.
In 2001 my mom. I had moved to San Francisco, he called me and told me to passed my request on the green card that I could go to live to the United States.
I was <unk>
I said to my mother, "Mommy, I'm <unk>
I'm here with friends, I like to travel and be a <unk> queen of <unk>
But then, two weeks later, he called me and said, "You know that if you ask the United States you can change the name and the identity of <unk>
It was all I needed to hear.
My mom suggested that I was putting myself on my name.
She also accompanied me when I was stuck in Thailand at 19 years.
It's curious that in some of the most rural cities in Thailand do the most rural and sophisticated surgeries and secure.
In that time, in the U.S., it was necessary to be done by surgery before they change the name and the gender.
So in 2001 I went to San Francisco, and I remember looking at the driving license with the name <unk> and the gender <unk> <unk>
It was a great moment.
For some people, your identity document means being able to drive or be able to get a <unk> but for me it was the license to live, to feel <unk>
Suddenly, my fears saw <unk>
I felt I could conquer my dream and move to New York, and be model.
Many are not so fortunate.
I think of this <unk> woman, <unk> <unk>
A young woman from New York City <unk> his truth, but that <unk> put his life end for his life.
For many of my community, that's the reality that they live.
Our suicide rates are eight times higher than the rest of the population.
All the 20 of November we do a global vigil by <unk> Day.
I'm on this stage thanks to a long history of people who <unk> and stood in front of the injustice.
These are Marsha P. Johnson and Sylvia <unk>
Today, right now, I'm coming out of the closet.
I can't continue to live my truth and just for me.
I want to do the best to help others live their truth without shame, nor fear.
I'm here, <unk> for some day no longer than 20 of them.
My deepest truth led me to accept what I am.
Would you?
Thank you very much.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.  <unk> <unk> <unk> a quick question.
<unk> <unk> Yeah.
My support network, my parents especially, my family, who is very strong.
I remember all the times that I have met young young women who have <unk> and sometimes when I was called and told me that their parents could not accept it, I would take my mom and say, "Mom, you can call this <unk>
Sometimes it worked -- it's not just identity identity, that's what it's in the center of what we are, right?
I mean, we all was assigned a gender at birth, and what I try to do is to put on the table that some times a few times a few times -- and that should be a space that would allow people to <unk> and this is a conversation that we should have with parents, with colleagues.
The <unk> movement is <unk> compared to the gay movement.
There's still a lot of work to do.
There should be understanding.
There should be space for curiosity and to ask questions, and I hope you all be my allies.
KS: Thank you. Very good. <unk> Thank you.
In many ways, tribal societies and tribal societies, they usually know them for their children, but I'm one of the few parents who are known for her daughter and I'm proud of it.
<unk> started his campaign by defending his rights in 2007. And when he was arrested, his efforts in 2011, to the <unk> National <unk> <unk> became very famous -- a very popular girl in her country.
Before that, I was my daughter, but now I'm her father.
Ladies and gentlemen, if we take a look at the history of mankind, the story of women is the story of <unk> of inequality, violence and exploitation.
You see, in <unk> societies right from the beginning, when when when we age, a girl, their birth is not <unk>
It's not welcome nor her father, nor for her mother.
The neighborhood is coming, day their <unk> to mother and no one to the father.
And a mother got a lot of fun to have a little girl.
When it gives birth to the first child, the first daughter, <unk>
When it gives birth to the second daughter, <unk> and, with the hope of a son, when she <unk> her third daughter, she feels guilty like a criminal.
Not only the mother <unk> but the daughter, <unk> <unk> when it grows, it suffers too.
At the age of five years, when I should go to school, it is at home and the school draws her brothers.
Up until the age of 12 years, in a way, has a good life.
You can <unk>
It can play with your friends on the street, and he can move around the streets like a butterfly.
But when it comes into adolescence, when it comes to 13 years old, he gives him to go out of his house without a male <unk>
It's confined to four walls of their house.
It's no longer a free person.
It becomes the so-called honor of his father and her brothers and her family, and if I was able to put the code of that of the honor, the could even kill.
And it's interesting that this of the honor code is not only affecting the life of a <unk> also affecting the lives of family members of the family.
So this brother <unk> the <unk> of his life, and the happiness of her sisters in the name of honor.
And there's a norm more than <unk> societies called <unk>
This is supposed to be very <unk> very humble and very <unk>
It's the judgment.
The model of a good girl should be <unk>
It is supposed to be <unk> and that accepts people's decisions and mother and mother decisions, even if you don't will.
If you put it with a man who doesn't like it, or if you <unk> it with an old man -- she has to <unk> because he doesn't want to be <unk>
If the <unk> very young, it has to take it.
Otherwise, <unk> <unk>
And what happens to the end?
In words of a <unk> "The <unk> <unk> and then it gives birth to more and <unk>
And the irony of the situation is that this mother, <unk> the same lesson of <unk> to his daughter and the same honor for her children.
And this vicious cycle continues and continues.
<unk> brothers and sisters, when I was born <unk> and for the first time, believe me, I don't like newborns, to be honest, but when I was there and looked at her eyes, believe me, incredibly <unk>
And so much before I was born, I thought of her name, and I was fascinated with a <unk> <unk> of freedom in Afghanistan.
His name was <unk> <unk> and I called my daughter so for her.
But when I got married, everybody was men, and I grabbed my pen, and I got a line of my name, and I wrote, <unk>
And when she grew, when she was four and a half years old and a half years on my school.
So you might be wondering, why should I mention a chance of a girl in a school?
Yeah, I should <unk>
You can give it for granted in Canada, in the United States, in many developed countries, but in the poor countries, in tribal societies, is a great event for the life of a child.
<unk> in a school means recognition of his identity and his name.
A classroom to school means that it's in the world of dreams and aspirations where it can explore its potential for your future life.
I have five sisters, and none of them could go to school, and you would be <unk> two weeks before, when I was going to get a Canadian Canadian Canadian form, and I was in the relative part to family, I couldn't remember my sisters.
And the reason I had never seen the names of my sisters written in any document.
That's why you value my daughter.
What my father couldn't give to my sisters and his daughters, I thought I had to change it.
I used to appreciate the intelligence and the <unk> of my daughter.
The <unk> to sit with me when my friends came to me.
He encouraged me to a different meetings.
And all of these values, I've tried to focus on their personality.
And this wasn't just for her, just for <unk>
I've got all these good values in my school to girls and boys alike.
I used education for <unk>
He taught my daughters, taught the students, forget the lesson of <unk>
I taught students to forget the lesson of the so-called <unk>
<unk> brothers and sisters, <unk> for more rights for women, and <unk> to have more and more space for women in society.
But we found ourselves with a new phenomenon.
It was lethal rights for human rights, and in particular, for women's rights.
It was called <unk>
That means a complete denial of women's participation.
Hundreds of schools were lost.
Girls <unk> to school.
Women were forced to use <unk> and they stopped going to the markets.
The musicians were <unk> girls and the singers were <unk>
<unk> millions, but a few <unk> and it was scary to have around those people who kill and <unk> when you talk about their rights.
It's really terrifying.
At the 10 years, <unk> he got up and raised by the right to education.
He wrote a newspaper for the BBC, of the BBC, he offered her same for the New York Times, and he talked about every platform he could.
And his voice was the most powerful voice.
It <unk> like a <unk> around the world.
And that was the reason why the Taliban couldn't tolerate their campaign, and the October of October 2012, 2012, he was shot in the head.
It was a <unk> day for my family and me.
The world became a big black hole.
Whereas my daughter was <unk> between life and death, he would love the ear to my wife <unk> <unk> by what happened to my daughter, <unk>
And <unk> he said, "Please don't get you."
<unk> the <unk>
<unk> your life in play by the cause of the truth, for the cause of peace, and by the cause of education, and your daughter was inspired by you and you get stuck.
Both of them were on the right path and God <unk>
These few words <unk> a lot to me, and I didn't ask again.
When I was <unk> I was in the hospital and had severe severe headaches and his facial nerve was cut, I used to see a dark shadow that was <unk> by the face of my wife.
But my daughter has never been <unk>
I used to be wondering, "I'm okay with my smile <unk> and with my face.
I'm going to put it well. Please don't get <unk>
It was a comfort for us, and it was <unk>
<unk> brothers and sisters, we've learned from her to be able to resist in the hardest moments, and I'm happy to share with you that even though being an icon for the rights of children and women, is like any <unk> girl.
<unk> when he doesn't end his task.
You fight your siblings, and I'm very happy for that.
People ask me, "What is special at my mentoring that has made so bold to <unk> so brave and <unk> and <unk>
I say, don't ask me what I did.
<unk> what I didn't do.
I didn't cut his wings, and that's it.
Thank you very much.
Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you.
I was <unk> of the brain 18 years ago, and since that day, science of the brain has become a personal passion for me.
I'm engineering.
And I want to tell you that I've recently joined the Google <unk> of Google, where I've had a <unk> to my <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> but all the work that I will talk about today about the science of the brain, I did before I met Google or outside my work there.
Having said this, there is a stigma when you get to a brain surgery.
You are still just like smart or not?
I'm not going to be smart.
After the <unk> I was missing a part of the brain, and I had to live with it.
It wasn't the gray, but it was the sticky sticky part of the center that creates important hormones and <unk>
Immediately after the operation, I had to decide how much to take over a dozen powerful chemicals every day, because if I didn't take anything, would die in a few hours.
Every day, for the last 18 years, I've had to decide about the combinations of chemicals and mix of chemicals, and try to fill it up with life.
More than once I have saved me.
But luckily, I have a soul of <unk> so I decided that I was going to try to get the <unk> dose, because it doesn't really exist.
I began to test them together, and I was shocked by seeing how small changes in the doses changed dramatically my sense of who I am, my way to think, my behavior with others.
A particularly <unk> case for a few months, I tried <unk> and chemical chemicals for a man of <unk> and I was surprised to see how my thinking changed.
I was always <unk> I thought all the time in sex, and I thought it was the smartest person around the world, and --  -- of course, a lot of times in the past, I've met several kinds of things, or maybe some versions of <unk>
It turned out as an extreme.
But my great surprise was that I wasn't trying to be <unk>
In fact, I was <unk> a little bit <unk> fixing a problem that had the front, and it just didn't happen that way.
So I couldn't handle it.
It changed my <unk>
But I think that experience gave me a new appreciation of men and about what they have to do, and I've been doing better with men.
What I was trying to get to that <unk> those hormones and neurotransmitters and so forth, I was to recover my intelligence after disease and <unk> my creative thinking, my flow of ideas.
I used to think almost in imagery, and that became my point of reference <unk> how do I get those mental images that I use to create <unk> my ideas, if you were going to have new ideas and <unk>
This kind of thoughts is not new.
<unk> like <unk> Descartes and <unk> look at things like this.
They thought that images and mental ideas were the same thing.
Today there are people who are <unk> this idea, and there are a lot of discussions about how the mind works, for me is simple: for most of us, the mental images are fundamental to <unk> thinking.
So after several years, I get to find the right point, and I have already lots of great mental <unk> really, really sophisticated and <unk>
Now, I'm working on how to bring these very quickly images of my mind on the screen of the computer.
Can you imagine what would happen if a cinema director was able to use their imagination only to lead the world that has the <unk>
Or if a musician could get the music of her head?
There are incredible possibilities with this, as the way that creative people can get to share at the speed of light.
And the truth is, the only difficulty to do is simply increase the resolution of our brain scanning brain systems.
Let me show you why I think we're pretty close to getting to this with two recent experiments that were done by two recent groups in neuroscience.
Both of them used an MRI MRI picture, to represent the brain -- here you can see brain scanning by <unk> <unk> and his colleagues at Harvard.
The column on the left shows the scan of the brain of a person who looks at an image.
The column of the middle is showing the scan of the brain of that same individual while you were looking at that same image.
The column on the right was created by <unk> the contents of the central column on the left, you see that the difference is almost <unk>
This is repeated in many different individuals with lots of different images with a similar outcome.
The difference between seeing an image and imagine seeing that same picture is almost <unk>
Now, let me share with you another experiment. This is from the Jack <unk> lab in Berkeley, California.
They were able to turn the brain waves into visual fields.
Let's put it in this way.
In this experiment, I showed the people hundreds of hours of YouTube YouTube while they were tracking their brains to create a large pool of reactions to the brain sequences.
And then they showed you a film with new images, new people, new animals, and as long as you get a new <unk>
The computer just using the brain information <unk> to show what seemed like the person was seeing.
On the right you can see the <unk> of the computer, and on the left, the video that I showed you.
This left us <unk>
We're okay close to this.
We just need to improve resolution.
And now, remember, when you see an image and when you imagine that same image, you create in the brain the same <unk>
This was done with the brain scanning brain systems that are available today, and their resolution was moved to a thousand times in the last few years.
Now we need to increase <unk> a thousand times more to get a deeper look.
How did we do that?
There are many techniques to do it.
One is opening up the skull and introduce electrodes.
I don't offer that one.
Many of you are proposing new techniques of projection projection by images, even me, <unk> with the recent result of the MRI -- we need to ask the next thing, this technology will be the end of the <unk>
The conventional wisdom says that the only way to get greater resolution is with larger magnets -- but at this point, magnets more <unk> only offer small improvements in the resolution, not increases by thousands of us as we need.
I propose this idea: rather than magnets bigger, let's make better magnets.
We can create much more complex structures with slightly different arrangements like doing a <unk>
And why does this matter?
In the last few years, a lot of effort in MRI were to make really big, right?
But most of the recent advances in <unk> of clever and brilliant solutions in <unk> and <unk> and <unk> in the <unk> and <unk> radio radio <unk>
At once, instead of a magnetic field they might be able to look at magnetic field -- structured magnetic frequencies -- at the radio frequencies.
So when you combine the magnetic patterns with the patterns of <unk> radio processing patterns -- we can increase the information that you can extract in a single <unk>
In addition, we can then split our growing knowledge on the structure of the brain and memory to create the increase in the thousands we need.
By using <unk> we should be able to measure not only the fluid fluid, but the <unk> hormones that I mentioned and maybe even neural neural activity -- this is sleep.
Will we be able to put our ideas directly into digital media.
Can you imagine if we could go above language and communicate directly through the <unk>
What would we be <unk>
And how do we learn to deal with the truths of the human thinking without <unk>
You thought the Internet is a big thing.
These are big questions.
It would be compelling to use as a tool to amplify our thinking skills and communication.
Certainly, this same tool can lead to Alzheimer's and similar disease.
We have few choices more than opening up this door.
Anyway, they choose one year, it will happen in five or 15 years?
It's hard to imagine it will take much more.
We need to learn how to take this step together.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk to you tonight about leaving the closet, and not in a traditional sense, not just the gay family.
I think we all have <unk>
And so your closet may be said to some person for the first time you love it, or say to someone who's pregnant, or tell someone who has cancer, or any other difficult conversation that you have through life in life.
All I do is a difficult conversation, and even though our issues can vary <unk> the experience of I've lived and have left that closet is universal.
It's fear, and we don't like it, and it must happen.
A lot of years ago, I was working on South Side Side -- and I had a restaurant in the city, and I was there, I had to go through several stages of the intensity of <unk> <unk> not <unk> my armpits, <unk> the letters of <unk> gave me <unk> as a <unk>
And I will be slope from the <unk> of my <unk> and I just got my head on the head of a little bit, I would ask you usually a kid -- "Hey, you're a kid or <unk>
And there would be a awkward silence at the table.
I got my jaw a little bit more, I would take my coffee with a <unk>
The father <unk> <unk> the newspaper and mother launched a cold look at his son.
But I would say nothing, and I would say it inside.
And I got to the point that every time I went to a boy between three and 10 years, I was ready to fight.
And that's a terrible feeling.
So I promised me that next time I would say something.
I should be that hard conversation.
So after a few weeks, it happened again.
"You're a guy or a <unk>
A family silence but this time I was prepared and I was about to get full of the female issues on the table.  I had the quotes of Betty <unk>
<unk> <unk>
Even a clip of the "Vagina <unk>
So just took a deep took and I went down the look and my backs a <unk> girl with a pink dress with a pink dress, looking at what is not a challenge for a <unk> <unk> just a little girl with a question with a question: "You're a kid or <unk>
So I took a journey back again, again, I put myself from her, and I said, "Hey, I know this is something <unk>
I have the short hair like a boy, and you see clothing in a boy, and I'm a girl, and you know, as you like to use pink dress and sometimes you like to use a <unk>
Now, I'm more of the kind of girl from a <unk>
And that girl looked at me <unk> paying attention, and he said, "My favorite leaves is <unk> and he has a fish.
Can you give me a <unk> for <unk>
And that was all -- "Oh, OK. You're a girl.
What about the <unk> <unk>
It was the easiest hard conversation than I ever had.
And by <unk> because the girl of the <unk> and I, we were both <unk> the one with the other.
So as many of us, I have lived in some closets in my life, and yes, often, my walls used to be a <unk>
But inside, in the dark, you can't know what the walls.
You just know how a feeling is living in a closet.
That's how my closet is not different about yours or yours.
I'm going to give you 100 reasons for why to get out of my closet was more difficult than coming out of his, but this is the <unk> it's hard not <unk>
The difficult thing is hard.
Who can tell me that explaining to someone who has declared to bank bank -- it's harder than telling you it's been <unk>
Who can tell me that this story that I tell you is harder than to tell your five-year-old <unk>
There's no more difficult thing, it's only that hard.
We have to stop classifying what is difficult to be difficult to make someone difficult for another person to make us feel better or worse in relation to our closets and we should only feel empathy because we all live in something hard.
At some point in our lives, we all live in <unk> and you can make them feel security, or at least security than the other side of the door.
But I'm here to tell you that no matter what your walls are made -- a <unk> is not a place to live.
Thank you.  Imagine about 20 years ago.
I, who had a horse tail, a dress and shoes and tall shoes.
It was not the lesbian <unk> ready to fight against any child of four years who would walk into coffee.
I was frozen for fear, <unk> in a corner of my dark myself, and my grenade -- and the move just a muscle is the scariest thing I've ever done.
My family, my whole friends, full strangers that I've spent my entire life trying to do not <unk> and now the world was turning back on purpose.
I was burning the pages of a script that we've all been followed by so long, but if you don't throw that <unk> to kill you.
One of my most memorable grenade was in my sister.
It was the first time that many of them were invited to be gay, and when I was doing my son of lady with an honor to my black dress and <unk> I walked around the tables and finally came to one where the friends of my parents, people who knew me was years ago.
And after talking a moment, one of the women <unk> <unk> <unk>
And the battle of the gay story had begun.
<unk> you had ever been in the <unk>
"Well, yeah, the truth is, we have friends in San <unk>
"Well, we've never gone there, but we've heard it's <unk>
<unk> You know my <unk> <unk>
It's very good, and it's never talked about having <unk>
What is your favorite TV show.
Our <unk> <unk> <unk>
And you know who <unk> us <unk>
Jack is our <unk>
And then a woman, <unk> but waiting to show her support, to make me know that I was on my side, finally said, "Well, sometimes my husband uses shirts <unk>
And I had an opportunity at that moment, as all the <unk> of <unk>
<unk> could have been easy to indicate where you felt <unk>
It's not very difficult to find them and realize that they were <unk>
And what else can you ask for someone, but <unk>
If you are going to be authentic with somebody, you have to be prepared for the real thing that you want.
That's how hard conversations are still without my strong point.
Ask anyone who I have <unk>
But I'm getting better, and I keep what I like to call the three principles of the Girl Village.
Now, please look at this through the gay perspective, but understand that what is going to come out of any way is essentially the same.
Number one: Be real.
<unk> <unk> Be yourself.
That girl in the coffee had no armor but I was ready for battle.
If you want somebody to be sick, the other needs to know that we do suffer.
Number two: Be the direct Be <unk>
If you know they're gay, <unk>
If they tell your parents that maybe they might be gay, they will maintain the hope that that might change.
They don't give you a sense of false hope.
And number three, and more important --  Let them complex.
You communicate their truth.
They would never be done by that.
And some of you can get out safe, <unk> so you have done, but I'm never sorry about what they are.
And yes, maybe some of you may feel <unk> but that something in them, not in you.
Those are the expectations of them about what you are, but not his.
That's the story of them, but not of you.
The only story that matters is that you want to write.
So the next time you find in a dark closet -- <unk> a <unk> you must know that we've all been there before.
And you might feel very alone, but they are.
Thank you, <unk> Enjoy the <unk>
<unk> what is that?
If you look at the story of how the intelligence has been seen -- a productive example has been the famous quote by <unk> <unk> that "The question of whether a machine can think of is as interesting as the question of if a sub can be <unk>
When <unk> <unk> wrote this as a criticism of the pioneers of computer computing as Alan art.
And so a few years ago, we set a program to try to understand the fundamental physical mechanisms of intelligence.
Let's go back a walk.
We first start with a mental experiment.
Imagine that they are from an <unk> race that you don't know anything about the biology of Earth or whether of Earth's intelligence or the Earth of Earth, but they have incredible telescopes, and you can see Earth, and they have incredibly long lives, so you can see Earth for millions, even billions of years.
And you see a very strange effect.
Of course, as <unk> we know that the reason we are trying to save ourselves.
We're trying to avoid an impact.
But if you are from a alien race that doesn't know anything about this, that it doesn't have any concept on Earth, you would be forced to develop a physical theory that would explain how, until a certain moment in time, the asteroids that we <unk> the surface of a planet -- <unk> they stop doing it.
And so I claim that this is the same question to understand the physical nature of intelligence.
So in this program that took a number of years ago, I studied a variety of issues through science, through various disciplines, that I believe, I think, to a single underlying mechanism of intelligence.
In <unk> for example, there have been a variety of evidence that our universe seems to be accurately at the development of intelligence, and in particular, for development of universal states that we will create the diversity of potential future.
Finally, in the middle of robotic movement has been a variety of recent techniques that have tried to harness the skills of robots to maximize the future freedom of action in order to perform complex tasks.
And so by taking all of these different themes and <unk> together, I asked a number of years ago, and there is a mechanism underlying the intelligence that we can extract from all these different <unk>
There's only a equation for intelligence?
And I think the answer is yes. What you're seeing is probably the closest equivalent of a E = <unk> for the intelligence that I have seen.
So what you're looking at here is a claim that intelligence is a force -- Fahrenheit, that acts with the end of maximize the future freedom of action.
It acts for maximize the future freedom of action, or keeping open choices, with a <unk> force -- with the diversity of potential <unk> Yes, to an impending future time, <unk>
In a nutshell, the intelligence doesn't like to be <unk>
The intelligence is trying to maximize the future freedom of action and keep the options open.
And so, having this equation, is natural to ask: What can you do with this?
How <unk> is it?
<unk> the level of human intelligence.
<unk> <unk> intelligence.
So I'm going to show you now a video that I think, will show some of the amazing applications of this simple equation.
Narrator: <unk> research in cosmology have suggested that universes that produce more disorder, or <unk> in their life should have to tendency to conditions more favorable for the existence of intelligent beings like us.
But what if that <unk> <unk> connection between entropy and intelligence -- a more <unk> relationship.
What if intelligent behavior is not only correlates with the production of the long-term entropy -- but it actually arises directly from it?
To find out, we've developed a software engine called <unk> designed to maximize the production of the long-term entropy in any system where you find inside.
<unk> <unk> could spend multiple animal tests -- playing games of human intelligence, and even make money <unk> actions, all of it without that there was right to do that.
Here are some examples of <unk> in action.
Just like a foot of foot without <unk> here we see <unk> <unk> automatically a pole using a <unk>
This behavior is remarkable partly because we never gave <unk> a goal.
He just decided to balance the <unk>
This ability to balance will have applications for <unk> robotics and human assistance technologies.
This ability of tools will have applications in intelligent manufacturing.
Also, like some other animals can cooperate just pulling opposite ends of a rope at the same time to release the food, here we see that <unk> can perform a version of the model of that task.
This ability of cooperation has interesting consequences for economic planning and in a variety of other fields.
<unk> is widely applicable to a variety of <unk>
For instance, here we see this successfully playing a game of <unk> against itself, <unk> its potential for play.
So here we see <unk> to orchestrate new connections on a social network where the friends are constantly <unk> and keeps the net right connected.
This same capacity of web <unk> also has applications in health care, in energy and intelligence.
Here we see <unk> organizing the routes of a fleet of boats, discovering successfully and using the Panama Canal to expand the world from the Atlantic to the Pacific.
In the same way, <unk> is widely applicable in defense and logistics and transportation.
Finally, here we see <unk> you'll find out and run a strategy of <unk> <unk> in a simulated series of actions, trying to successfully increase assets under their exponentially.
This ability for risk management will have huge applications in finance and safe.
Alex <unk> What you've seen is that a variety of assumptions of smart cognitive behaviors, such as the use of tools, walk upright and social cooperation from one equation, that leads to a system to maximize their future freedom of action.
Now, here's a deep <unk>
Let's go back to the use of the term of the term -- the <unk> play, there was always the concept that if we were born, smart machines, there would be a rebellion of <unk>
The machines are <unk> against us.
One of the biggest consequences of this work is that maybe all of these decades, we've had all the concept of rebellion in reverse.
It's not that machines are becoming smart and then <unk> and trying to take over the world.
It's all the other other thing that the impulse to take control of all future future is a more fundamental principle that of intelligence, that general intelligence can actually emerge from taking control, instead of being upside down.
Another important consequence is the search for target.
People often ask me, how do you look for targets to learn from this kind of <unk>
My equivalent of that statement to go to the descendants to help them build <unk> or to help them build artificial intelligence or to help them understand human intelligence, is this: intelligence must be seen as a physical process that tries to maximize the future freedom of action and avoid constraints in their own future.
Thank you very much.
We are at a tipping point in human history, something between the <unk> of stars and losing the planet that we call <unk>
Even over the last few years, we've expanded our knowledge of how the Earth fits in the context of the universe.
The NASA mission mission has discovered thousands of potential planets orbiting other stars, which points around other stars, which is just one among billions of planets in our galaxy.
Kepler is a space telescope which measures the faint light intensity of the stars when the planets go ahead of them, and they jam a little bit of that light that gets us.
The data gathered around the Kepler show the sizes of planets in addition to the distance that there is between them and their <unk> star.
In together, this helps us to understand whether these planets are small and <unk> like the Earth planets of our solar system, and also the amount of light that they receive from their <unk>
At their time, it gives you clues about whether these planets we find are habitable or not.
Unfortunately, while we're finding this trove of worlds potentially <unk> our own planet is <unk> under the weight of humanity.
<unk> was the most hot recorded.
<unk> and sea ice that have been with us since a millennia, now they're disappearing in a matter of decades.
These environmental changes that we have caused on a global scale have been rapidly <unk> our ability to disrupt its course.
But I'm not a weather scientist and the weather, no <unk>
But I study the <unk> of the planet influenced by stars, hoping to find places in the universe where to discover life beyond our planet.
You might say I'm looking for alien opportunities in the property sector.
Now, as someone very interested in the search for life in the universe I can tell you that the more accurate planets like the Earth, the more I enjoy our own planet.
Each of these new worlds invites a comparison between the newly discovered planet and the planets that we know better than our solar system.
Let's take our neighbor, Mars.
Mars is small and <unk> and despite being a little farther away from the Sun, it may be considered a potentially livable world that is a mission like the Kepler <unk>
In fact, it's possible that Mars has been habitable in the past, and in part, is why we study so much to Mars.
Our <unk> like <unk> track its surface looking for clues about the origins of life as we know it.
The satellites that are <unk> like the <unk> mission, they take samples from the <unk> atmosphere, and they try to understand how Mars has been able to lose their <unk>
private companies now offer not only short space flights but also the possibility of living on Mars.
But even though all of these images, they remind us remind the deserts of our planet, places that are linked in our imagination with the ideas of <unk> and <unk> compared to the Earth, Mars is a pretty terrible place to live.
Let's take the extension of the <unk> areas of our planet that still remain <unk> places that are really <unk> in comparison to Mars.
Even in the <unk> and lower places on the Earth is fresh and full of oxygen <unk> by our tropical forests to thousands of miles away.
I worry that this excitement for the colonization of Mars and other planets can get a big and sad thing, the implication and the belief in some of the things that Mars is waiting for this <unk> <unk> <unk> of the only planet that we know that is truly livable on Earth.
So I like <unk> exploration, I disagree with this idea.
There are lots of good reasons to go to Mars, but to say that Mars will be there to safeguard humanity is as an imagine that the captain of Titanic will comment on the <unk> <unk>   Thank you.
But the goals for <unk> exploration, and preservation is not <unk>
No, they are actually faces of the same <unk> the goal to understand, preserve and improve life in the future.
The extreme environments present in our world look like <unk> aliens.
They are just closer to home.
If we can understand how to create and maintain spaces in the hostile and the <unk> spaces of the land, maybe we can meet the need to preserve our environment and go beyond that.
Let me leave you with a <unk> <unk> <unk>
A lot of years ago, the physicist Enrico Fermi asked myself, "What our universe has been around for a long time, and we hope that there were a lot of planets in this universe, we should have found evidence of existence of alien life so far.
Okay, where are they?
Well, a possible solution to the Fermi paradox is that when civilizations become advanced advanced advanced to consider to continue to live between the stars, they lose the notion of what's important to protect the origin of the planets that we <unk> this development.
It's arrogant to think that only colonization <unk> will be saved by ourselves, but the modern preservation and exploration, can work together.
If we really believe in our ability to address the hostile environments of Mars for human presence, then we should be able to overcome the <unk> task to preserve the <unk> on Earth.
Thank you.
A few years ago, I would take my own house.
And as I was on the front porch looking at my pockets, I realized I didn't have the keys.
In fact, I could see the window that was on the dining table where there were <unk>
So quickly I tried to open all the other doors and windows and all these were very rare.
I thought I would call a <unk> at least had my cell phone, but at midnight, a <unk> could take a long time to get in, and it was cold.
I couldn't go home from my friend of Jeff to spend night because I had a flight early to Europe in the next morning, and I had my passport and <unk>
<unk> expensive, but it's sure you don't more expensive than a <unk> at half night, so I thought, despite the circumstances, I'm going to stop.
I am a profession and I know a little bit about how the brain works under stress.
<unk> <unk> which is increasing heart rate, and you will reduce the levels of adrenaline and <unk> the thinking.
And when I got to the <unk> <unk> at the airport, I realized I had no passport.
Well, I had a long time to think about those eight hours without sleep.
And I began to ask myself, if there was something that I could do, systems that could put in his place, which <unk> that happens to bad things.
Or at least if bad things happen, which is the probability that it is a total catastrophe, right?
So I started thinking about that, but until a month later my thoughts were <unk>
I was having dinner with my colleague Danny <unk> <unk> of the Nobel Prize, and a little embarrassed I told him that he broke the window, and I had forgotten my passport, and Danny shared with me who had been practicing something called hindsight <unk>
It's something that he had learned from the psychologist Gary <unk> who had written this a few years earlier, known as the <unk>
You all know what <unk>
Every time there's a disaster, a team of experts come and tries to figure out what went wrong, right?
In the <unk> as an explains <unk> you look forward and try and figure out all the things that could go wrong, then try trying to figure out what it can do to prevent things out or to minimize the damage.
So what I want to talk to you about is some things that we can do in the form of a <unk>
Some of them are <unk> they're not so <unk>
I'm going to start with obvious.
In the house, you get a place for things that are very easily.
This sounds common and it is, but there's a lot of science that supports this <unk> based on how our space memory.
There's a structure in the brain called hippocampus, which has evolved over thousands of years, to track the location of the important things, where the things are right, where the fish are, where the tribes are <unk> where the tribes live -- friends and <unk>
The hippocampus is the part of the brain that <unk> in the <unk> in London.
It's the part of the brain that allows the <unk> to find their nuts.
And if you ask if somebody really did the experiment, they cut the sense of <unk> <unk> and they could still find his nuts.
They didn't use the smell, but the hippocampus, that very evolved mechanism of the brain to find things.
But it's really good for things that don't move much, not so good for things that are moving.
This is the reason for losing keys from reading and <unk>
So at home -- a place for the keys, a hook up to the gate, maybe a <unk> dish.
For your passport, a <unk>
For your reading, a particular <unk>
If you take a place and they're <unk> with it, your stuff will always be out there when you get them.
What about <unk>
Take with the cell phone a picture of your credit card license from drive, passport, passport, please please yourself so that they're in the cloud.
If these things are missing or <unk> this can be <unk>
These are some of the most obvious things.
Remember, when you're under stress, the brain releases your lifespan.
<unk> is toxic and <unk> the thinking.
So part of <unk> practice is to recognize that under stress we will not be at the best moment, and you have to put the systems on your site.
And there's perhaps no more stressful situation than when you face a medical decision.
And at some point, we're all going to be in that situation, to have to make a very important decision about the future of our medical care or the one to be dear, to help you with a decision.
And so I want to talk about that.
And talk about a very particular medical condition.
But this is <unk> as a <unk> for all of them making medical decisions, and in fact for the decision of financial decisions and social choices, any kind of decision that you need to take from the rational one of the rational one of the facts.
So suppose you go to the doctor and the doctor says, "I've got the result of the lab and the cholesterol is a little bit <unk>
You all know that high cholesterol is associated with a greater risk of heart disease attack on the heart of the brain.
So you're thinking that having high cholesterol is not the best, then the doctor says, "I'd like to give you a drug that will help you reduce the <unk> a <unk>
And maybe you've heard about the <unk> and you know it's one of the most successful drugs in the world today. Even you know people who are <unk>
So you think, "Yes, <unk> <unk>
But there's a question that you have to do then, is a statistic that you should ask for which most doctors don't want to talk, and companies are even less.
It's for the <unk> the number necessary to treat.
And what is this, the <unk>
It's the number of people who have to take a drug or transplant surgery in any medical procedure before you can help a person.
And you must think of what kind of statistical statistic is <unk>
The number needs to be one.
My doctor didn't give me something if I wasn't going to help me.
But actually, medical practice doesn't work like this.
And it's not the doctor, and if it's about somebody, it's of scientists like me.
We haven't understood very well <unk> mechanisms.
But <unk> estimates that 90 percent of the drugs works only about 30 percent of the people.
So the number needs to treat the most widely <unk> which do you think it is?
How many people have to take it before you can help a person?
300.
This is the research of the researchers who cynical <unk> and Pamela <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
I have the numbers.
300 people have to take the drug for a year before they avoid a single heart attack, stroke or another <unk> event.
Now maybe you think, "Well, one probability in 300 of my <unk>
Why no, <unk> <unk> the recipe for everybody <unk>
But then you have to ask for a more statistic -- and it is, <unk> of the <unk> Yeah?
For this particular medicine, the side effects are produced in five percent of the patients.
And those include real things that include muscle pain and <unk> pain and <unk> pain -- but they are now thinking, "The five percent is not very likely to me, even if you take the <unk>
But a moment.
Remember that under stress doesn't think clearly.
So think about how you do this with the time, so you don't have to make the kind of reasoning on the act.
300 people take the drug, right? A person has <unk> five percent of the 300 side effects that are 15 people.
You have 15 times more likely to get out of the drug to help you your drug.
I don't say they had to take the <unk>
I just say they must have this conversation with your physician.
The medical ethic is required. It's part of the principle of informed consent.
We have access to this kind of information to start the conversation about whether you want to take the risks or not.
Maybe you're thinking that I've launched this number in the air for the value of the crash, but actually this needs to be quite typical.
For surgery that is more done in the older men in the 1950s, <unk> <unk> of cancer, the number necessary to treat is <unk>
That's what 49 surgery is, or a person who has <unk>
And the side effects of that case, they produce in 50 percent of the patients.
Those include the helplessness or dysfunction -- <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And if you get lucky, and it's one of that 50 percent of the effects only one year or two.
So the idea of <unk> is to think before the questions that you can argue that we will take the conversation forward.
You don't have to make all this stuff on the act.
And they also want to think about the quality of life.
Because you have a lot of choice many times, they want a <unk> life of pain, or a longer life that could have a lot of pain to the end?
These are the things that they talk about and think about now, with their family and their loved ones.
You can change opinion in the heat of the moment, but at least you are trained in this kind of thought.
Remember, our brain releases <unk> under stress, and one of the things that happens at that moment is that you turn a lot of systems.
There's an evolutionary reason for this.
Face with a <unk> you don't need the <unk> system or the immune system, because if the body is spending the metabolism in those things, doesn't react very quickly. They could get the lunch lunch -- so nothing really matters.
Unfortunately, one of the things that go through the window during those moments of stress is the logical sense.
So we need to think about the future of this kind of situations.
I think the important thing here is to recognize that we are all <unk>
We're all going to fail in time.
The idea is to think about the future of how you might be those <unk> to put the systems into the place that will help to minimize harm, or to prevent things out in the first place.
I went to the snow night in Montreal when I came back from my journey, my contractor and I settled on a combination of combination along the door, with a key to the gate with an easy way to remember it.
And I have to admit that I still have lots of cards that I haven't <unk> and lots of text messages that I haven't seen.
So I'm not really organized, but I see the organization as a <unk> process, and I'm doing it.
Thank you very much.
Interpreter: <unk> <unk> is my favorite <unk>
It means <unk> <unk>
If you're playing a musical instrument, and you see a <unk> on the <unk> you need to play <unk>
Two <unk> even <unk>
Four <unk> extremely smooth.
This is my drawing of a tree of <unk> there you see that no matter how many thousands and thousands of <unk> may be, never <unk> to a complete silence.
That's my current definition of <unk> a very dark sound.
I'd like to share a little bit about the history of the U.S. American system, the <unk> in addition to a little bit of my own story.
The French signs came during the age of 1800, and over time, mixed with local signs, and he developed the language that we now know as <unk>
So, it has a story about 200 years.
I was born <unk> and I was taught to believe that sound was not a part of my life.
And I thought it was true.
However, I realize it's not true to nothing.
The sounds are a very important part of my life, they're really in my mind every day.
As a <unk> person who lives in a sound world, is like I lived in a foreign country, following <unk> their rules, <unk> behaviors and rules without <unk>
So how do I understand the sound like?
Well, I see how people behave and respond to sound.
People are like my speakers and <unk> the sound.
<unk> and <unk> that behavior.
At the same time, I've learned that I can create sound, and I've seen how people cosmic people.
So I've learned, for example ...
"I don't <unk> the <unk>
"Don't do a lot of noise when you eat the bag of potato chips.
"Not <unk> and when you're eating, you know, not <unk> the covered in the <unk>
I call this <unk> <unk>
Maybe I think of the sound tag more than the average person does it.
I'm super <unk>
And I'm always waiting for <unk> the sound that is going to come next.
There is this drawing.
<unk> for decide.
<unk> to go on.
<unk> for <unk>
You can see that <unk> has no notes in the lines.
That's because the lines already contain sounds through the subtle <unk> and <unk>
In <unk> culture, movement is equivalent to sound.
This is the signal for <unk> in the <unk>
A typical <unk> has five lines.
But for me, to do this with my thumb that doesn't feel natural.
That's why in my drawings I've only got four lines on the paper.
In 2008, I had the opportunity to travel to Berlin, Germany, for an artistic residence there.
Before this time, I had worked as a <unk>
During this summer, I visited museums and different <unk> and as I went from one place to another, I realized there was no visual art there.
At that time, the sound was the trend and that called me the <unk>
There was no visual art, everything was hearing.
Now the sound has come into my territory of art.
I'm going to tell you more about art?
I realized it doesn't have to be like this.
In fact, I know the sound.
I know it so well that it's not only experienced through the ears.
I can feel it <unk> or something visually, or even an idea.
So I decided to reclaim the sound property and <unk> in my art practice.
And all I had taught me about the sound, I decided to leave it and <unk>
I started to create a new body of work.
And when I presented it to the art community, I was <unk> with the amount of support and attention I got.
I realized that sound is like money, power, power -- social currency.
In the bottom of my mind, I always felt the sound was <unk> was a little listener.
And the sound is so powerful that I might be able to blame me and my artistic job, or I could tell me.
I chose that I <unk>
There's a massive culture around the speech language.
And just because I don't use my literal voice to communicate, the eyes of society is as if I had no voice at all.
So I have to work with people who can support me as well as and become my voice.
So I am able to be relevant in today's society.
So in school, in the work and institutions, I work with many different performers and <unk>
And his voice becomes my voice and identity.
They help me be <unk>
And their voices have value and weight.
Ironically, when you ask for <unk> your voices, I'm able to keep a temporary way of something like taking a loan from a very high interest rate.
If I will not continue with this practice, I feel that I could be able to <unk> it in <unk> and not have any social value.
So with sound like my new artistic medium -- <unk> in the world of music.
And I was surprised to see the similarities between music and <unk>
For example, a musical note cannot capture and to express fully on the paper.
And the same thing can be said from a concept in <unk>
The two are very <unk> and highly <unk> which means that subtle changes can affect all the meaning as much as the signals as the sounds.
I'd like to share with you a metaphor for the piano, so you understand better how the <unk> works.
So imagine a piano.
<unk> is divided into many different <unk>
If you <unk> a <unk> different for each finger while the facial expression, the motion of the body, the speed, the shape of the hand and so while the piano touches the piano, English is a linear language, as if you're going to take a key to the time.
However, the <unk> is more like a <unk> you need the 10 fingers <unk> to express a concept or idea in <unk>
If only a key would change the <unk> it would create a completely different means.
The same thing happens with the music in terms of and <unk> and volume.
In <unk> when you use these different parameters, you can express different ideas.
For example, the <unk> signal in that."
This is the <unk> signal in that."
I'm looking at you.
<unk> <unk>
Oh, I <unk>
<unk> <unk>
What are you <unk>
Ah, <unk>
So I started thinking, and if I look at <unk> through the <unk>
If I had to create a sign and put it over and over again, it could be like a piece of visual music.
For instance, this is the sign of <unk> the sun comes out and <unk>
This is all the day."
If you look at it, and you get the speed, visually looks like a piece of music.
The whole day.
I feel that the same can be said from <unk> <unk>
"All <unk>
This is all night, in this drawing.
And this led me to think about three different types of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
I feel like the third one has more <unk> than the other two of them.
This is how time is expressed in <unk> and how the distance to the body can express changes in time.
For example, one <unk> is a hand, two <unk> is two hands, <unk> is two hands, the present is getting closer and in front of the body, the future is in front of the body and the past is on the back.
So the first example is <unk> a lot of time."
Then <unk> <unk> <unk> and the last one, which is my favorite, with a very dramatic idea at the time and a dramatic <unk>
<unk> <unk> is a musical term with a specific rate of <unk>
However, when I look at the word <unk> <unk> I think automatically in <unk> same time."
You see <unk> <unk> <unk> left hand.
We have the <unk> through the head and the chest.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
You can do it with me?
Everyone with your hands high.
Now we're going to do it so much in your head like your chest, something like <unk> <unk> or <unk>
Yeah, very good.
That means <unk> in the international system.
The international system as a note, is a visual tool to help to communicate in all cultures and language languages worldwide.
The second I'd like to show you is this: Please do it with me again.
And now this.
It means <unk> in the <unk>
Now, the third. Please <unk> again.
And again.
It's <unk> in the <unk>
Let's do the three together.
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
Good job.
Look at how three signs are very similar. They all happen in your head and the chest. But they pass it very differently.
It's amazing to see how <unk> is alive and thriving as the music.
However, today, we live in a very <unk> world.
And only because the <unk> doesn't have sound automatically -- it has no social value.
We need to start questioning what defines social value and allow the <unk> to grow its own value, without sounds.
And this could be a step to make a more <unk> society.
And maybe people understand that you don't have to be deaf to learn how to learn, and I don't have to hear to learn music.
<unk> is a rich trove of trove and I'd like you to have the same experience.
I'd like to give you to open his ears, open the eyes, to participate in our culture and experience of our visual language.
And you never know, they can even fall in love with us.
Thank you.
<unk> <unk> Hey, that's me.
As a child, my parents would say, "You can <unk> everything, but then you have to <unk>
freedom involves responsibility.
But my imagination led me to all these wonderful places, where everything was possible.
So I grew up in a bubble of innocence or a bubble of ignorance I should say, because adults lie to us to protect us from the horrible truth.
When I got older, I learned that adults also <unk> and they're not very good at cleaning up the other people.
The time country, now I'm an adult and invention in the <unk> school of Hong Kong.
You don't have to wait a lot for my students to walk on the beach <unk> with lots of garbage.
So as good citizens, <unk> the beaches, and no, it's not drinking alcohol, and if it is, I don't know it.
It's sad to say, but more than 80 percent of the oceans contain plastic.
It's something creepy.
And in the last few decades, we've been coming out with these big ships and networks, and we collect those plastic bits to study under the microscope, and the <unk> and <unk> this information on a map.
But it lasts for an eternity and it's very expensive and it's also very risky to use those huge boats
So along with my students, with ages six to 15 years, we dream about invent a better way.
We've transformed our tiny classroom in Hong Kong in a workshop.
We begin to build this <unk> labor <unk> so that the kids are very <unk> they can also participate.
And I'll tell you, kids who manipulate electrical tools are cool and safe.
Not exactly.
Let's go back to plastic.
We collect the plastic and we reduce the size we find it in the ocean, which is very small, because of its <unk>
That's what we do.
I leave it to the imagination of my students.
My job is to try to take the best ideas of every child and try to focus on something that we hope to work.
We decided that instead of collecting pieces of plastic -- only information <unk>
By using a robot, we took an image of this <unk> the children are <unk> very much with robots.
Then we created what we call "a <unk>
We're so quick in creating prototypes that we ended up before lunch.
And we transformed the lights and camera cameras on it, and you put it into a floating robot that goes slowly through the water and the plastic we have there, and this is the picture captured by the robot.
We see the pieces of plastic floating down slowly through the sensor while the computer on board process this image and measuring the size of every particle, so you get an estimate of the amount of plastic in the water.
<unk> this world-changing invention on a website for inventors called <unk> with the hope that someone else gets it even more.
The great thing about this project is that the students saw a local problem, and <unk> are trying to fix it immediately.
And I looked at my problem with me, but my students in Hong Kong are very <unk>
You see the news, they look at the Internet, and they get stuck with this <unk>
A child, maybe under 10 years, cleaning an oil spill, just using the hands in <unk> the largest <unk> forest in Bangladesh.
They were really surprised because this is the water that you drink, is the water that you get in, the water where the water is going to look at the place where you live in.
You can also see that the water is brown, the mud and the oil are also <unk> and when you all <unk> it is very difficult to see what's in the water.
But there is a simple technology called <unk> which allows you to see what's in the water.
We built a very first prototype of a <unk> that can <unk> through all kinds of substances that produce different wages, what can help identify what is in the water.
We put this prototype with a sensor, and we send it to Bangladesh.
The great thing about this project is that beyond solving a local problem, or analyzing a local problem, my students used their empathy and their sense of creativity to help the other children.
And I was forced to investigate a problem with <unk> I was forced to do a second experiment, and I wanted to go a little further, maybe to address a more difficult problem, and also closer to me.
I'm half Japanese and French half and maybe remember, that in 2011, there was a devastating earthquake in Japan.
It was so violent that it gave up several giant waves called <unk> called <unk> and those <unk> destroy various cities on the coast of Japan.
More than 14,000 people died in a second.
It also gives the nuclear power plant from Fukushima, a nuclear power station to water.
And today, according to the reports of the average of 300 tons are still pumped from the nuclear plant in the Pacific Ocean.
Today, all the Pacific Ocean have traces of pollution by <unk>
If we go to the west coast, we can measure <unk> radiation everywhere.
But if you look at the map, it looks like most of the radiation disappeared from the Japanese coast, and the majority of the time, it looks like sure, is blue.
Well, the reality is a little bit more complicated than that.
I've come back to <unk> every year from the crash and research independently with other scientists, the land, the river, the river, and this time we wanted to take the kids.
Of course we don't <unk> the parents not <unk>
But every night we reported to the center of the <unk> here you see the <unk> use here.
It might seem like they didn't take the work seriously, but they did it because they're going to have to live with <unk> all their life.
Together with them we discussed data that day, and we talked about what we were going to do later, <unk> <unk> etc.
And to do this, we created a <unk> map of the region around the nuclear power plant.
We created the map of <unk> introduced <unk> to represent data in real time of <unk> and <unk> water to simulate rain.
So with this we could notice that the radioactive dust will spread from the top of the mountain towards the <unk> system, and it <unk> in the ocean.
It was a <unk> estimate.
But based on this we organized an civil expedition, the closer to the nuclear power to date.
We got closer to a half miles of the nuclear station, and with the help of the fishermen that we were collecting sediments from the sea floor with a tracking system of sediment as we invented and build.
Here we see a <unk> we've gone from a remote problem to a remote problem to a global problem.
And it's been very exciting to work on these different scales, as well with open-source technologies and very simple.
But at the same time, it's been increasingly frustrating because we've only been starting to measure the damage we've done.
We haven't even started trying to solve the problems.
I wonder if we should give the leap and try to invent better ways of doing all of these things.
So the classroom became a little bit so small so we found an industrial installation in Hong Kong and we converted it into the larger space dedicated to social impact on environmental impact.
It's in the center of Hong Kong and it's a place where we can work with wood, metal, chemistry, a little bit of biology, -- basically, you can build almost all over there.
It's also a place where adults and children can play together.
It's a place where kids can become reality with the help of adults, and where adults can be kids again.
Students: <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> we asked things like, we can invent the future of mobility with <unk> energy?
For example.
Or well, we can help in the mobility of the advanced population to transform their <unk> wheelchair in new vehicles.
The plastic, the oil and the oil and the <unk> are <unk> terrible, but the worst legacy we can leave our children are <unk>
We can't afford to protect the children of the horrible truth because we need their imagination to invent the solutions.
So citizen scientists, creators, we have to prepare the next generation to be concerned about the environment and people, and so I can actually do something about it.
Thank you.
Two domes -- two cultures of radically opposite design.
One is made of thousands of pieces of steel, the other one of a single silk silk.
One of them is synthetic -- the other organic.
One imposes on the environment, the other one believed it.
One is designed by nature, the other for it.
Miguel angel said that when he looked at the <unk> <unk> he saw a figure that is free.
The <unk> was only <unk>
But living beings are not <unk>
They grow.
And in the smallest units of life, the cells, we took all the information that for each cell to work and work for it.
The tools also have consequences.
At least from the Industrial Revolution, the world of design has been dominated by <unk> of manufacturing and production in mass.
The assembly lines have <unk> a world made out of parts, including the imagination of designers and architects trained to think of their objects, as <unk> parts of different functions.
But you don't find <unk> material in nature.
Think about the human skin, for example.
Our facial skins are thin with <unk> <unk>
The skins of the back are <unk> with little <unk>
You act mainly as a filter and another mainly as barrier, and yet it's the same <unk> there is no parts, no <unk>
It's a system that is gradually going to vary its functionality through variation in <unk>
Here is a split screen, which represents my view of the world -- the <unk> personality of every designer and architect to work at working between the <unk> and the gene, and the gene, between the machine and the organism, between assembly and growth, between Henry Ford and Charles Darwin.
These two visions of the world, my left hemisphere and the right, analysis, and synthesis, it shows on two screens after me.
My work, on its simplest level, tries to unite these two visions of the world, stepping out of assembly and getting down to growth.
You probably wonder, why now?
Why wasn't it possible this 10 or even five years?
We live in a very special moment in history, a rare moment, where you have four disciplines that offer designers access to tools that we never had access to before.
And at the intersection of these four fields, my team and I create.
Please meet the minds and the hands of my students.
We designed objects, products, structures and tools and tools through the <unk> <unk> structures like this <unk> robotic arm with a <unk> based on diameter with a <unk> base, which is some day not too far to print <unk> and graphics <unk> facts -- genetically <unk> <unk> in the dark.
Here we have <unk> the <unk> an archetype of ancient African architecture, and has created a screen where every single aperture is only to shape the shape of light and heat through it.
In our next project, we explored the possibility of creating a layer and a <unk> -- this was for a fashion fashion tape of Paris with <unk> they're <unk> It's like a second skin made from one piece, <unk> in the <unk> flexible <unk>
Along with 3D printing printing -- we printed this layer and 3D <unk> <unk> between the cells, I'll show you more objects like that.
This helmet combines rigid and rigid materials in the resolution of 20 <unk>
This is the resolution of a human hair.
It's also the resolution of a brain scanner, <unk>
That designers have access to this high resolution and <unk> instruments that allow the design to design products that are <unk> not just the shape of our bodies, but also the physiological structure of our tissues.
We've also designed a acoustic chair a chair to the comfortable <unk> and also that absorbs sound.
The Carter professor -- my collaborator, went back to nature to <unk> and to design this pattern of surface surface -- it becomes <unk>
So let's take this surface of 44 different properties, which vary in <unk> <unk> and color, <unk> the pressure points in the human body.
Their surface, as in nature, changes its functionality not through the addition of another material or another <unk> but <unk> continuously and <unk> the material.
But it's the <unk> nature.
There are no parts in nature?
I was not raised in a religious Jew but when I was young, my grandmother told me stories of the Bible <unk> and one of them got me to define a lot of what it matters.
As she <unk> "In the third day of <unk> God sends the Earth to grow a <unk> <unk> <unk>
For that first tree, there would be no difference between trunk, form leaves and leaves and <unk>
The whole tree was a fruit.
Instead, the land was growing trees with twigs, <unk> water and flowers.
The Earth created a world made out of place.
I often ask myself, "What would design do if objects made out of one part?
<unk> a better state of <unk>
So we looked at the material that we can sort of <unk> the kind of material of the <unk> tree with fruit, and we found it.
The second <unk> more abundant on the planet is called <unk> and about 100 million tons are produced every year by organisms like shrimp, and feels, <unk> and <unk>
We thought that if we could tune their <unk> we could generate <unk> structures in one piece.
So that's what we did.
We call it legal <unk>  We asked a lot of husks of shrimp, the <unk> and we produced <unk>
<unk> chemical concentrations we've been able to achieve a wide range of <unk> from dark, hard and <unk> to light, soft and transparent.
To print the large-scale structures in scale, you built a system with multiple <unk> <unk> <unk>
The robot could vary the properties of the material and create these structures from the march and create these structures from one single year three feet long, 100 percent.
When the pieces are ready, it leaves them dry to find a natural form in contact with the air.
So why do we keep designing with <unk>
The air bubbles that were a byproduct of the printing process used to contain <unk> <unk> which appeared for the first time on the planet three billion years ago, as we heard yesterday.
Together with our collaborators at Harvard and MIT, <unk> the bacteria designed to capture very rapidly capture carbon from the atmosphere and turn it into sugar.
For the first time, we have been able to generate structures that make their transition without <unk> <unk> to mesh, and if it broadens even more.
A <unk> tree.
Working with an old material, one of the first life forms of life on the planet, with abundant water, and with a little of synthetic biology, we've transformed a made made of shrimp seed husks in an architecture that behaves like a tree.
And here is the best <unk> for objects designed to <unk> them in the sea, and they put life together and put it on the ground, they will grow a tree.
The fit for our next exploration using the same design principles was the solar system.
We are looking for the possibility of creating clothes to keep the life for <unk> travel.
To do that, we must dominate the bacteria and control their flow.
So as the board, we did our own table of <unk> new forms of life created <unk> made <unk> and <unk> in biological form.
I like to think of synthetic biology as the liquid alchemy that the liquid alchemy -- just instead of <unk> metal metals -- new <unk> into very small channels.
This field is called <unk>
We put our own 3D channels to control the flow of these <unk> <unk> <unk>
In our first piece of clothing -- two <unk> <unk>
The first one is <unk>
It lives in our oceans and in the ponds of fresh water.
And the second E. <unk> the bacteria that live in the human intestine.
One turns into sugar, the other sugar <unk> and produces useful biofuels for the built environment.
But these two <unk> don't interact in nature.
In fact, they never <unk>
They're here, designed for the first time, to have a relationship to a piece of clothes.
Think of it as evolution, not by natural selection, but evolution for design.
In order to contain these relationships, we've created a single channel that looks like the <unk> tract that will help you flow through these bacteria and that they will take their function of way.
So we started to grow those channels into the human body, <unk> the properties of material according to the functionality of <unk>
If we wanted more photosynthesis, it will provide more transparent channels.
This system is <unk> <unk> <unk> when you stretch out of one end to another, it's about 60 feet.
This is half the length of a football, and 10 times more than our very gut <unk>
And here it is, like <unk> at TED, our first <unk> <unk> shiny channels with life inside of the clothing.
Thank you.
Mary <unk> said, "We are golden creatures -- only half is <unk>
What if design is <unk> the other <unk>
And if we could create structures that increase <unk> matter.
And if we could create personal <unk> that we <unk> our skin, <unk> the tissue that is harmed and <unk> our <unk>
Think of this as a form of edit biology.
I call this the material ecology.
For that, you always have to go back to nature.
So now, you know that a 3D printer involves <unk> material.
You also know that nature doesn't do that way.
<unk> <unk> with <unk>
This cocoon of <unk> for example, creates a highly <unk> architecture in which they were <unk>
<unk> is about this level of <unk>
It does it through the combination of two materials, but two different proteins in different <unk>
A acts like structure, the other one is the glue or the matrix, put those fibers into each other.
And this happens to the scales.
The silk worm first turned into the environment, creates a tension, structure and then starts to <unk> a cocoon of compression.
The tension and the <unk> the two forces of life, they manifest themselves in a single material.
In order to better understand how this complex process works, we attach a small magnet to the head of a silk worm to <unk>
We put it inside a box with magnetic sensors and that allowed us to create this cloud cloud in three dimensions and visualize the complex architecture of cocoon of the silk worm.
But when you put the silk worm in a flat patch -- not within a box, we realized that we would take a flat, <unk> cocoon still <unk>
So we started designing different parts of different countries, and we've discovered that the shape, the composition, the structure of the <unk> is transmitted directly by the environment.
And so often they <unk> the silk worms to the death inside its <unk> its silk <unk> and it uses the <unk> industry.
We saw that designing these <unk> we can shape <unk> silk, not boiling a single <unk>
It <unk> <unk> and we could create these things.
So we launched this process to the architectural scale.
We had a <unk> robot, making silk <unk> and we put it on our site.
We knew that <unk> silk worms are going into the darker and the <unk> of that we use a solar route to reveal the distribution of light and heat in our structure.
So we create holes or <unk> to block the rays of light and heat, and then it is the silk worms on the structure.
We were ready to get <unk>
We asked <unk> silk worms to a silk farm online.
And after <unk> four weeks, they were ready to fit it with us.
We put them carefully at the bottom of the <unk> and as they <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and life begins again, like us, but much, much <unk>
Buckminster Fuller said that tension is the big integrity, and he was right.
By <unk> biological silk about <unk> silk, they give all this pavilion to its integrity.
And in a little more than two or three weeks, <unk> silk worms, <unk> miles.
In a curious symmetry -- this is also the length of the silk route.
<unk> after the <unk> produce 1.5 million eggs.
This could be used for 250 extra <unk> in the future.
So here are the two visions of the world.
A silk <unk> through an robotic arm, the other full empty arm.
If the final frontier of design is to give the products to the products and the buildings around us, to form a new ecology of two materials, designers must bring these two visions of the world.
What drives us from a turn, of course, at the beginning.
Here's a new era of design, a new era of creation, which takes us from a inspired design in nature to a nature inspired by design, which demands for the first time, that we make care of nature.
Thank you.
Thank you very much. Thank you.
Hands up if you ever wondered what you want to be <unk>
If you had to remember how old they had when they first asked this?
You can stick with your fingers.
Three. Five.
Now, raise your hand if you ask what you want to be <unk>
It caused them some kind of anxiety.
Any anxiety.
I'm somebody who could never answer the question, "What do you want to be <unk>
The problem was not that I had no interest, but I had <unk>
In the school I liked the English, the <unk> and the art and made it online sites, and I also played the guitar in a punk band called <unk> <unk>
Maybe you've heard about us.
And generally I like to test and persist anyway, for having spent a lot of time and energy and sometimes money in this field.
But with the time this feeling of <unk> this feeling of, this is no longer a challenge, it comes to you.
And I have to give it up.
But then I was going to tell me something else, something completely different, and I would get stuck with it, and I'm going to let me absorb it, and I feel <unk> I found it <unk> and then again this point where I start to <unk>
And finally, I want to give it up.
But then I'd like to discover something new and different, and I would like to get a way into that.
This pattern had a lot of anxiety, for two reasons.
The first was because I wasn't sure how I was going to convert all this into a career.
I thought I had to choose one thing, deny all my other passions and send them to <unk>
Another reason I had so much anxiety was a little more personal.
I worried that there was something wrong with this, and something bad in me because of nothing.
I was concerned to be afraid of engagement, or whether to be dispersed, or to <unk> or to my own success.
If you can relate to my story and these feelings, I would like to ask you something that I'd like to have raised me then.
Ask themselves, where learned to allocate the meaning of evil or abnormal to do things.
I'll tell you where the <unk> learned from culture.
We ask you first question: "What do you want to be <unk>
When we have about five years.
And the truth is that nobody cares about what they <unk>
It's considered a naive question to make nice answers in the children like, to be <unk> or <unk> or <unk> or "I want to be <unk>
I was going to get the guise of <unk> here.
This question is done over and over again as we grow in different ways, <unk> <unk> to high school students, ask them to pick up in college.
And at some point, "What do you want to be <unk>
It's going to be the cute exercise of being the nice exercise of the dream.
Why?
If this question is inspired by children to dream with what they might be, doesn't inspire dreaming of everything that they might be.
In fact, it does exactly the other thing, because when someone asks you what you want to be, you cannot respond with 20 different things, although adults are going to be <unk> and say, "Oh, what nice, but you can't be <unk> and <unk>
You have to <unk>
This is Dr. Bob <unk>  and he's a <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And this Amy <unk> editor turned into <unk> <unk> and a creative <unk>
But most kids don't hear about people like this.
All you hear is that they're going to have to choose.
But it's more than that.
The notion of life is very <unk> in our culture.
It's this idea of fate or the real vocation, the idea that every one of us has something that I spend during their time on this land, and you have to figure out what that thing is, and dedicate your life to it.
But if you're someone who is not connected to this way?
What if there are a lot of different issues that wake up their curiosity and lots of different things that want to do?
There's no place for someone like one in that framework.
And so you can feel alone.
You can feel it has no goal.
And feeling something wrong with one.
There's nothing wrong with you.
You are a <unk>
A <unk> is somebody with a lot of interests and creative activities.
It's a <unk> so I say.
It could help if you divide up in three parts: a <unk> potential and <unk> potential.
You can also use other terms that we can use the same idea, like <unk> <unk>
The ideal of the Renaissance was the ideal for the ideal it was <unk> in multiple disciplines.
Barbara <unk> refers to us as <unk>
You get any term you like or <unk> your own.
It seems to me as a kind of adapt to a community, we can't agree with one identity.
It's easy to see <unk> as a limitation or woe you should win.
But what I've learned talking to people and writing about these ideas on my website, which is that there are huge strengths in the way that way.
Here are three superpowers going on.
One: the synthesis of ideas.
That is, the combination of two or more fields and creating something new in <unk>
<unk> <unk> and Rachel <unk> <unk> their shared interests in cartography, visualization of data and travel, math and design, when I found <unk>
<unk> is a company that creates jewelry. <unk>
<unk> and Rachel came up with this unique idea by her <unk> mix of skills and experiences.
Innovation is happening at intersections.
These new ideas.
And we put them with all their background, you can access a lot of these points of <unk>
The second superpower, <unk> is fast learning.
When we put them into something, we go to it.
We looked at everything we can have in our hands.
We're used to <unk> for having been a lot of times in the past, and this means that we have less afraid of testing new things and out of our comfort.
Many skills are <unk> to other disciplines, and we bring all the things that we've learned to every new area that we <unk> so we rarely start from zero.
<unk> <unk> is a complete <unk> and a full-time writer <unk>
As a girl who was an amazing ability to develop muscle memory.
Now, she's the fastest best known one.
Before I become a writer, it was <unk> financial <unk>
He had to learn the most thin sales mechanics when they were starting their practices, and this skill helps you write the compelling <unk> of the editors.
It rarely is a loss of time to go to what you would give you to you even if you were the end of the end of it.
It's possible to apply that knowledge in a completely different field, in a way that you could not have <unk>
The third superpower superpower -- it's the adaptability. That is, the ability to transform into anything that you need in a given situation.
<unk> <unk> is sometimes director of videos, another web pages, a web pages, sometimes consultant from Kickstarter, sometimes teacher, and sometimes James <unk>
It's valuable because it makes a good job.
He's even more valuable because it can take diverse roles depending on the needs of your clients.
<unk> magazine called adaptability defines adaptability as the most important skill for development, to flourish in the 21st century.
The economic world changes so quickly and <unk> that are the individuals and organizations that can be <unk> to meet the market needs that really <unk>
<unk> of ideas, quickly learning and <unk> three skills where <unk> are very <unk> and three skills that could be lost if they're <unk> to reduce their goals.
As a society, we have a great interest in encouraging <unk> to be themselves.
We have complex problems, <unk> right now, and we need creative thinkers not to deal with them.
Let's say they are, in your heart, <unk>
<unk> of belly knowing because they wanted to be neurosurgeons <unk>
Don't worry, there's nothing wrong with you.
In fact, some of the best teams are made from a specialist and a <unk> <unk>
The specialist can dive deep and put into ideas, and the <unk> offers a breadth of knowledge to the project.
It's a beautiful relationship.
But we should all design lives and careers that are connected.
And unfortunately, the <unk> in a lot of them are <unk> to just be more like their <unk>
Once I said this, if there is one thing that you take away from this talk, I hope that it's this: <unk> with the internal <unk> whatever it is.
If you are a heart doctor, then you put all the media.
That's where you give the best of yes.
But for the <unk> in the room, including those who just realized being one of them in the last 12 minutes,   I tell you, <unk> with your whole bunch of passions.
Keep her curiosity for those <unk> <unk>
<unk> the intersections.
We <unk> our internal wiring leads to a more authentic and happy.
And perhaps most importantly, <unk> the world is <unk>
Thank you.
In the year I was attributed to a woman called <unk> they brought it to a psychiatric <unk>
<unk> <unk> and I couldn't remember even the most basic details of your life.
His doctor was called <unk>
<unk> I didn't know how to help <unk> but <unk> for her until unfortunately passed away in <unk>
After his death, <unk> did a bath, and found strange dishes and <unk> in the <unk> brain of a guy that had never seen before.
What's even more astonishing here.
If we had been living today, we could not give it to her more help than <unk> gave him <unk> years ago.
<unk> was Dr. <unk> Alzheimer's.
And <unk> <unk> the first patient to receive a diagnosis that we now call Alzheimer's disease.
From <unk> medicine has advanced <unk>
You have discovered antibiotics and vaccines to protect us from the <unk> many treatments for cancer, <unk> for HIV, <unk> for <unk> and so much more.
But it's been progress in Alzheimer's disease.
I'm part of a team of scientists who work to find a cure for Alzheimer's for more than a decade.
So I think about this all the time.
Alzheimer's now affects 40 million worldwide.
But by 2050, it will affect 150 million which, by the way, will include a lot of you.
If you expect living to live to 85 years or more, the chance of Alzheimer's disease will be almost one of every two.
In other words, there is the probability that they spend their years Alzheimer's or helping to take care of a friend or to be dear Alzheimer's disease.
In America, Alzheimer's care costs 200 billion dollars every year.
One of five dollars of health care is spent on Alzheimer's disease.
Today is the most expensive disease and its costs -- a five times in 2050, as the generation of <unk> boom.
You may surprise you, but Alzheimer's is one of the biggest medical and social challenges of our generation.
But it's done relatively little to <unk>
Today, one of the top 10 causes of death around the world, Alzheimer's is the only one that cannot be <unk> to cure or even slow their development.
We understand less than Alzheimer's than other diseases because we spend less time and money on the research of itself.
The U.S. government spends 10 times more every year in today's cancer research that in the fact that we have more Alzheimer's and causes a similar number of deaths like cancer.
<unk> is due to a more fundamental cause, the lack of consciousness.
Because this is what time people know, but the whole world is <unk> Alzheimer's is a disease, and we can <unk>
For most of the last couple of years, all of all, the scientists -- even scientists, <unk> Alzheimer's with aging.
We think that will be <unk> in a normal and inevitable part of aging.
But you only have to look at a picture of a healthy person who compared to the disease patient.
In addition to trigger a severe memory and mental skills, the damage to the brain caused by Alzheimer's disease significantly expectancy and is always deadly.
Remember, Dr. Alzheimer's found plates and <unk> strangers in the brain of <unk> a century ago.
For almost a century, we didn't know much about this.
Today we know that they're made of protein molecules.
You can think of a protein molecule like a piece of paper it folds up as an origami.
There are places in the role that are <unk>
And when it folds out, these dots -- these dots end up inside the inside.
But sometimes things go wrong, and some <unk> points are left outside.
This makes the protein molecules are beating each other, forming groups that can form large plates and <unk>
That's what we see in the brain of patients with Alzheimer's.
We've spent the last 10 years at Cambridge University trying to understand how this <unk> works.
There are many steps, and identifying what step block is complex, as a bomb.
He <unk> a wire could do anything.
<unk> others can make the bomb explode.
You have to find the right step that we did, and then create a drug that does it.
Until recently, in its most part, they have reduced the wires and waited the best.
But now there's a diverse group of people, doctors, biologists, <unk> -- physical, engineers and mathematicians.
And together, we've managed to identify a critical step in the process. Now we're testing a new kind of drugs that block specifically this step to stop the disease.
I'll show you some of our last results.
No one out of our lab has seen it yet.
Let's see a few videos of what happened to test these drugs in <unk>
These are the healthy worms -- and you can see that they move normally.
These maggots, on the other hand, have protein molecules that are thrown into each other, as we have Alzheimer's.
And you can see that they're clearly <unk>
But when we give our new drugs to these worms in an early stage, then we see that <unk> and live a normal life.
This is just an initial <unk> but research as this sample that Alzheimer's is a disease that we can understand and cure.
After <unk> years of wait, there's real hope of what can be achieved in the next 10 or 20 years.
But to grow that hope, to overcome Alzheimer's disease, we need help.
It's not scientists like me, it's about you.
We have to argue that Alzheimer's is a disease and that if we use it, we can <unk>
In the case of other diseases, patients and their families have Wikipedia more research and <unk> pressure on governments, <unk> and <unk> industry.
That was essential to progress on HIV treatment in the late 1980s.
Today we see that same unit to overcome cancer.
But Alzheimer's patients often can't talk about themselves.
And their families, the hidden victims of their loved ones and night, are often too <unk> to go out and advocate for change.
So it really depends on you.
Alzheimers is not mostly a genetic disease.
Everybody with a brain runs the risk.
Today, there are 40 million patients like <unk> that cannot create the change they need for themselves.
<unk> talking about them, and to help demand a cure.
Thank you.
I published this article in the New York Times, New York Times, in January of this year.
To fall in love with somebody, I do this.
The paper is about a psychological study designed to create romantic love in the lab, and in my own experience by testing it myself one night last summer.
So the procedure is quite simple: Two strangers are <unk> to get 36 questions, more and more personal questions, and then they both look at the eyes without talking for four minutes.
Here's a couple of questions of example.
Number one: If you could wake tomorrow in a quality or skill, what would it be?
Number one: When was the last time you put to another person?
And <unk>
<unk> that are increasingly personal.
Number <unk> <unk> I really want to tell you, Tell your partner what you like to call it, or it, I know very honest this time, and I gave things that I don't say to someone you've ever met.
When I stumbled across this study a few years ago, a really bad detail really struck me, the gadget that two of the participants had married six months later and invited all of the lab to <unk>
So, it was <unk> about this process of making romantic love, but of course, I was also <unk>
And when I had the opportunity to test this study, with somebody who knew not particularly well, I didn't expect to go.
But nevertheless, we were <unk> and  And I thought it was a good story, so I send it to the neocortical column.
That was published in January, and now it's August, so I suppose some of you will probably wonder, keep together <unk>
And the reason I think is <unk> this is because they've done this question over and over again in the last seven months.
And from this question is what I want to talk about today.
But let's go back to it.
A week before the paper would post the paper was so nervous.
I had been working on a romantic book in the last few years, so I had told me to write about my experience in romantic love on my blog.
But a blog entrance can get to a few hundred view like a lot, and those were usually just my Facebook friends and imagined that my article in the New York Times would reach probably a few thousands of noticed.
And that had a good attention burden in a relatively new relationship.
But I had no idea.
The article was published on a Friday night, and on Saturday, this came in the traffic of my blog.
And the Sunday, I had already been called today's Show and "Good <unk> <unk>
In a month, the paper got over eight million views, and I was like, to say something, little prepared for this kind of attention.
One thing is to foster trust writing with its own <unk> experiences, but something else is to discover that the loving life of one has been international news --  -- and that people around the world are really interested in the state of your new relationship.
And when people call it or <unk> what they did every day for weeks -- they were doing first the same question: Even together?
In fact, when I was preparing this talk, I made a quick search on the mailbox of my email with the phrase: <unk> still <unk>
And several messages appeared on immediately.
They were from students and journalists and strangers were <unk> like this.
I was interviewed in the radio and I got it.
But I gave a talk, and a woman screamed up to the stage, "Hey <unk> where is your <unk>
And I immediately became red.
I understand that this is part of the deal.
If you write about your relationship in an international journal, you should expect people to feel comfortable asking about it.
But I wasn't prepared for the scale of the answer.
The 36 questions seemed to have <unk> life.
In fact, the New York Times published an article <unk> for San <unk> who included the experiences of readers when I test the study in them with different degrees of success.
So my first urge to all this focus was to be very <unk> with my own relationship.
I said not to every petition that we both did a public emergence together.
I read TV interviews, and they would encourage the orders of photos of us two.
I think I was afraid of becoming the icons <unk> of the <unk> process, a range that I didn't feel at all <unk>
And I understand that people didn't want to know only if the study worked -- they wanted to know if it was really <unk> I mean, if it was able to produce love, not just a adventure, but love, love <unk>
But this was a question I didn't feel able to answer.
My relationship was just a few months, and I felt about everything, that people said the wrong question.
How do we know if we go together or not, and they also <unk>
If the answer was not, I would do the experience of doing these 36 fewer questions.
Dr. Arthur <unk> wrote first about these questions in this same study in 1997. And there, the research goal was not to make romantic love.
Instead of that, I was looking at interpersonal students, among university students, using what they were doing, called <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Sounds romantic, right?
But the study does work.
The participants felt closer to doing it, several <unk> studies, they also used <unk> protocol -- as a fast way of creating trust and interaction between strangers.
They have used it between members of the police and community, and they've used it between people of <unk> political <unk>
The original version of the story, which I tried last summer, and we combined personal questions with four minutes of visual contact with four minutes of eye contact, it was cited in this article but unfortunately never <unk>
A few months ago, I was giving a talk in a little liberal arts university, and then a student came up to me and he told me <unk> I tried the study and it didn't work.
He seemed <unk> by it.
And I said, Do you want to say that you give you from the person who I <unk>
Well he did.
I think she just wants us to be friends.
And I said, but they became better friends?
<unk> that they managed to get better better than test the <unk>
The <unk>
So, <unk> I said.
However, I don't think that was the answer that he was looking for.
In fact, I don't think it's the answer that none of you are looking for when it comes to love.
I stumbled across the study for the first time when I was 29, and I was going through a really difficult separation to it.
I had that relationship since I had 20, which was pretty much my adult life, and he was my first true love and I had no idea how or I could live without him.
So I took myself to science.
And I did research all that I could find on the science of romantic love, and I expected that that could kind of <unk> the heart.
I don't know if I realized this at the time, I thought I just went through the book that I was writing -- but in retrospect, it seems really <unk>
I thought that if I came up with the knowledge of romantic love, I would never have to feel so bad and used as I felt back then.
And all of this knowledge has been useful in one way or another.
I am more patient with love. I'm more <unk>
I have more trust to demand what I'm after.
But I can also see me more clearly, and I can realize that what I'm looking for is sometimes more than reasonably much than reasonably demand me.
What I'm looking for love is a <unk> not just being <unk> today and being <unk> but I'm going to continue to be <unk> in the person I love.
It may be that this is the guarantee that people asked when they wanted to know if we were still together.
The story that the media told about the 36 questions is that there may be a shortcut to <unk>
There may be a way for some way to mitigate some of the risk of risk -- and this is a very <unk> story, because fall in love to feel beautifully, but it's also terrifying.
But I think when it comes to love, we're very willing to accept the short version of history.
The story of the story that asks, and still together?
And your content with a answer of Yes or No.
So more than a question -- <unk> that we make questions more difficult, questions like, how do you decide who deserves your love and who doesn't?
How are things going to be in love with love when things go down, and how to know when to cut and <unk>
How do you live with the uncertainty that inevitably leads to a relationship? Or even more, how do you live with doubt of your <unk>
I don't know necessarily the answers to these questions, but I think they're a good beginning to have a more <unk> conversation about what it means to love someone.
So, if you want the short version of the history of my relationship, it's <unk> a year ago, a known one, and we applied a study designed to create romantic love, we are passionate about, we still follow together, and I'm very <unk>
But fall in love is not the same thing to remain <unk>
<unk> is the easy part.
So at the end of my article. The love didn't happen.
They had fallen in love because we took the choice to be.
And I <unk> a little bit at reading it now, not because at the moment, he had no thought of everything that I was supposed to do.
It didn't mean how many times we would take that decision, and how much I will have to keep doing that choice without knowing before if he always chose me or not.
I want you to be enough to have done and responded questions, I have chosen to love someone so generous, kind and fun and have expressed that choice in the largest newspaper in the United States.
But what I've done, instead is to convert my relationship to the kind of myth that I don't really believe.
And what you do, and what you might spend my life looking for is that that myth is true.
I want the conclusion to implicit in the title of my paper, which is, by the way, the only part of the paper I didn't actually written.
But what I have in change is the opportunity to choose someone, and the hope that he will also love, and it's frightening, but that's the deal with love.
Thank you.
I was raised by a little lesbian in full <unk> and in a way I came up like a forest <unk>
The city of New York does a while.  One thing that really affected me but more details later on.
I'll start with when I was eight years old.
I took a wooden box and put a dollar bill a dollar, and a pen and a fork in her somewhere in Colorado.
And I thought that a few <unk> or some aliens would find this box about 500 years later and <unk> how our species would be <unk> for example how we eat <unk>
I had no idea.
Anyway, it has grace because here I am, 30 years later, and I'm still making boxes.
At a moment, I was in <unk> <unk> like going from tour and <unk> and all of those things <unk> and I was doing a collage for my mother.
And I took a dictionary and I took all the pages and I took all the pages and I made a kind of <unk> <unk> to Mr. Martin, the covered in resin and a bee <unk>
Well, my mother is afraid of bees and he is encouraged to put them more resin on the canvas, thinking I could <unk>
Instead, it happened to the opposite of the opposite -- it somehow seemed that it <unk> as well, as if it was that you get the text with a <unk>
So I did do that? I built more boxes.
This time, I began to add electronic elements, frogs, weird bottles that I was finding out of the street, everything I could find, because I was looking for things all my life, trying to <unk> and tell stories about these objects.
So I started drawing around objects, and I realized that God I can draw in space.
I can flow <unk> just like a <unk> <unk> <unk>
And I pulled out the objects and created my own taxonomy of specimens from <unk>
First of all, you know that you can get an idea.
Then I did some insects and strange creatures.
It was very much fun to draw on the layers of <unk>
And it was great, because I started building exhibitions and those things, and I was earning some money, to take my girlfriend for dinner, for example, going to <unk>
It was great man.
At some point I got interested in the human form -- sculptures of natural size with drawings of human beings inside the layers.
It was great, except for one thing: I <unk>
I didn't know what to do, because the resin was going to kill me.
And I was going to bed every night thinking about it.
So I tried to use glass.
So I started drawing on the glass sheets, similar to the drawing in a window on a window, and then another window, and I had all these windows together that formed a three-dimensional composition of view.
And this really worked, and so I could stop using <unk>
So I did this for years, and my work with something very big, I call <unk>
For the <unk> I was really inspired by "The <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> which is a painting at the Museum of <unk> in Spain.
Do you know that?
Well, it's a fantastic picture.
They say it's a little ahead of your time.
Well, the <unk> <unk> this piece.
It weighs <unk> pounds.
5.5 feet long.
It's twice a face, so it's 10 feet of composition.
It's a little bit weird.
Well, that's the source of blood.
On the left, is Jesus and <unk>
There's a cave where all these creatures with heads of animals travel between two worlds.
They go out of the world, the <unk> of <unk> <unk> where they <unk>
This is where creatures with animals are headed by <unk> lists for suicide in mass <unk> in the ocean.
The ocean is comprised of thousands of elements.
This is a bird <unk> tied to a <unk>
Billy Graham is in the <unk> The <unk> -- the <unk> -- the <unk> platform of the <unk> <unk> the refuge of Osama bin Laden, there are all kinds of weird things that you can find if you look very well in the ocean.
And anyway, also sort of <unk>
It's coming out of the ocean, and it spits out oil in a hand while the other hand is clouds.
Their hands are like <unk> and it looks like a <unk> that holds the Earth and the cosmos in balance.
So it's one aspect of the <unk>
It's a little story.
That's the hand that we <unk>
And then when you go on the other side, it has a <unk> like a bird <unk> and it spits out clouds from this <unk>
It also has a <unk> tail.
Anyway, their tail gives a <unk> on a <unk>
I don't know why it happened.
Things that go by, you know.
Their tail ends up in a eyeball of <unk> <unk> Mother's Day cards.
They've been <unk>
They did in the 1980s, as if they were baseball cards from terrorists.
Very good at your time.  This brings me to my last project.
I'm in the middle of two <unk> One is called <unk>
This is a six-year-old project to make 100 of these human beings.
Every one is a file of our culture, through media and material are <unk> dictionaries or magazines.
But each one acts as a kind of a human being, and they travel in groups of 20, four or 12.
They're like cells, they come together, they divide up.
And you can walk between them. It's running years old.
Each one is basically a microscope, which weighs 1.3 pounds with a human trapped inside.
This is a little cave in the chest.
That's the <unk> he's the chest, you can throw it down.
I'm going to see you for the rest of the body -- there's a waterfall coming out of the chest, and it covers the penis or <unk> or whatever it is, you have a kind of <unk> thing.
It's a quick review of these works because I can't afford it for a long time.
We have layers, you can see.
This is a game in half.
This is two heads and it's communicating between the two.
There's some pills coming out and come into the head of this strange <unk>
There's a little forest scene inside the <unk> <unk>
You can <unk>
Anyway, this talk is about these <unk> just like the boxes we live in.
We are in a box, the solar system is a box.
This brings me to my last box.
It's a brick box called <unk> <unk>
In this box there is a physicist -- a neuroscientist, a musician, a musician, a writer, a musician, a writer, an editorial arm that spreads all the content we do in the world and a garden.
It <unk> the box and all of the people in <unk> to each other like particles.
And I think that's the way we change the world.
When you get older, who is and the box in which it's living on.
And together we get to realize that we're all together in this, that this illusion that we are different, these concepts of countries, of borders, it doesn't work.
We're all very made of the same matter and in the same box.
And if we don't begin to swap those things with sweet and <unk> we're all going to die very soon.
Thank you very much.
What do they do when hurt your head?
They take a <unk>
But so that this pill has effect on pain, first goes through the stomach, the guts and other organs.
You take a pill. It is the most effective and <unk> system for any of the <unk> medicine in the body.
The <unk> though, is that the <unk> any drug is <unk>
And this is a big problem, especially in HIV patients.
When they take personalized drugs that are <unk> to decrease the amount of viruses in blood and increase <unk> cells.
But they are also known for their side side effects -- in their negative most of the negative, because in the time that it takes us to get to the current stream -- is <unk> and worse, even for the time it takes it to get to fate, which is where it's more important, in HIV HIV.
These are regions of the body like the lymph nodes the nervous system, the lungs, where the virus is <unk> and it doesn't go easily into the bloodstream, of patients that are attributed to regular therapy with antiretroviral drugs.
However, after sleep sleep, the virus can wake up and infect new cells.
So this is the big problem of HIV treatment with the current drugs that is a treatment of life being managed by the oral life.
One day, I sat down and I thought, <unk> to get the treatment directly into the virus, without the risk of <unk>
As a scientific expert in <unk> the answer was in front of me, the <unk> of course.
If you use it in <unk> for the care of wounds and surgery and diabetes can be used for anything else -- including transportation <unk>
In fact, we're using laser pulses to open or drill extremely small holes, which open and closing almost immediately from the cells living with HIV to introduce the medications.
You ask the best people ask, "How is that <unk>
We sent a little bit and a laser beam on the cellular membrane with HIV while these cells are embedded in a liquid that contains the drug.
The laser goes through the cell, while the cell absorbs the drug in a matter of microseconds.
Before you even notice, the hole is <unk> immediately.
We're testing this technology in vitro or <unk> plates, but the goal is to bring this technology into the human body, apply it to the human body.
"How is that <unk> you can ask.
Well, the answer is, through a device of three heads.
With the first head, which is our laser, we'll do a <unk> on the site of the infection.
The second head, which is a camera, it leads to the site of the infection.
Finally, the third head, a <unk> that distributes the drug, it releases it directly into the site of infection, while the laser is used again to keep the cells open.
Well, this doesn't seem a lot of time.
But one day, if it's successful, this technology can lead to total eradication of HIV in the body.
Yes. A cure for HIV.
This is the dream of all researchers from <unk> in our case, a laser treatment.
Thank you.
In the last decade, I've studied armed groups and armed organizations like terrorists, insurgents or <unk>
And so you get what these groups do when they're not <unk>
My goal is to understand better to these agents of violence from violence and studying ways of encouraging the transition from violent participation to the <unk>
I do the field work in the world of politics and the library.
Understanding these groups are key to solving almost all conflict in course, because the war has changed.
It used to be a dispute between states.
Not anymore.
Now it's a conflict between states and non-state actors.
For instance, from <unk> peace agreements between 1975, and 2011, <unk> had been signed between a state and a non-governmental actor.
And so we need to understand these <unk> we even need to be <unk> or <unk> in any process of successful conflict.
But how do you do it?
We need to know what motivates these organizations.
We know very well the reasons why they do that, but nobody looks at what they do when they don't <unk>
The armed struggle and political struggle is <unk>
It's all part of the same organization.
We can't understand these groups, not much less <unk> without a global vision.
The armed groups of these are complex organizations.
For example, the <unk> <unk> known for his violent <unk> against Israel.
From their creation in the 1980s, <unk> has also established a political game, a network of social services and a military device.
Similarly, the Palestinian <unk> known for their suicide bombers for Israel, also running the <unk> of Gaza from 2007.
So these groups make more than just to fire.
They're multitasking it.
It will give you a complex machinery of communication stations stations.
And here they have the <unk> magazine in English and published to <unk>
Robust groups are also investing in a complex fundraising fundraising <unk> but through <unk> businesses, for example, building companies.
These activities are key.
They allow these groups to increase their strength, increase their funds, to make better and build their brand.
Robust groups are also doing something else: they create stronger ties to their population by investing in social services.
They build schools, run hospitals, they run hospitals, put professional training programs or <unk> programs.
<unk> offers all these services and more.
Robust groups are trying to conquer the population offering something that the state is not <unk> security and protection.
The rise of the Taliban in a Afghanistan <unk> by war or even the beginning of the rise of <unk> may also understand the efforts of these groups for providing safety.
Unfortunately, in these cases, security has an elevated price for the population.
But in general, providing social services means filling up a <unk> a <unk> gap by government, and it allows these groups to strengthen and increase their power.
For example, the presidential victory of 2006 <unk> cannot be understood without acknowledging the social work of the group.
It's a really complex scenario -- even in the West, when we look at these groups -- we just think about the violent side.
But that's not enough to understand the strengths of these groups, the strategy or the long-term vision.
These groups are hybrid groups.
<unk> because they fill gaps by the government, and emerge as armed and political groups, participate in the violent struggle and make governance.
And the more complex and sophisticated things are these organizations, we can less <unk> as something contrary to a state.
How do I call a group like <unk>
And it's part of a territory, running all of its functions, collect the trash running the <unk> system.
It's a state? It's a <unk> group.
Or maybe it's something else, something new and different.
And what is <unk>
The lines were <unk>
We live in a world of states, of nations without the state and hybrids and the weak people are states, like in the Middle East today, the more intervene and fill that gap <unk>
This is important for governments, because to counter these groups will have to invest more into the military tools.
You know, that diversity of government has to be at the center of any sustainable approach.
This is very important to set up and <unk>
If we understand better groups -- we will understand better how incentives to offer violence from violence to the violence.
In this new dispute between states and actors, actors can win some battles, but we don't give peace and stability.
In order to achieve these goals we need long-term investments to fill out that safety, to fill that safety of government that enabled these groups to thrive in a principle.
Thank you.
I am a failure as a woman and a feminist.
My opinions about gender equality is <unk> but I'm afraid to accept the label of <unk> it would be unfair for <unk>
I'm a feminist, but pretty bad.
And so I was overwhelmed as a bad feminist.
Or, at least, I wrote an article and a book called "The <unk> <unk> and then in the interviews, people started calling me the <unk> <unk>
So what started as a personal joke meant to myself and a <unk> <unk> has become a big thing.
Let me give you a step back.
When I was young, especially in my youth and at the age of 20 years, I had strange ideas about the <unk> these women <unk> <unk> with men and hate sex. Like if that were a bad thing.
Today, I see how women are treated around the world and anger, in particular, it looks like a perfectly reasonable response.
But at the time, I was worried about the tone that I was using people to the <unk> who might be a feminist.
Be labeled as a feminist was a <unk> a taboo and unpleasant word.
I love myself as a woman who doesn't follow the rules, which is asking too much, with high self-esteem and <unk> to believe it's equal or higher to a man.
No one wants to be that woman <unk> until you realize that it's actually that woman and you can't imagine being another person.
Over time, as I grew up, I started to accept that I am, in fact, <unk> and also proud of it.
For me, certain claims are <unk> women are equal to men.
They would have the same wages for the same work.
We have a right to travel around the world as well as <unk> <unk> or violence.
We have a right to use it as easy and accessible to the contraceptives and the <unk> services.
We have the right to decide about our bodies, without the need for checks or doctrines for <unk>
We have the right to respect.
There's more.
When you talk about the needs of women, you have to have on account our other <unk>
We're not only women.
We are people with a different body, expression of gender, religion and our social condition and a lot more.
We need to have to account these differences and how we get ourselves in the same way that matters what we have in common.
Without this kind of <unk> our feminism is not anything.
For me, these truths are <unk> but to be clear: I'm a disaster.
I'm full of contradictions.
There's a lot of things that make me a bad feminist.
I have another confession.
When I drive to work, I hear rap music <unk> it all volume.
Although the letter degrades the women and offends me deeply, the classic <unk> <unk> from the yin yang of the yin <unk> is amazing.
He actually got your shirt <unk>
<unk> <unk>
Think about it.
They are <unk>
I'm completely excited about my musical rights.
I firmly believe in the work of man, which is all I don't want to do, <unk> -- all of the <unk> tasks -- but they also kill insects, the trash collection and the traffic collection and the maintenance of <unk>
I don't want to have anything to do with that.
The rose is my favorite color.
It was <unk> from fashion magazines and nice things.
I can see "The <unk> and the <unk> <unk> and I have physical fantasies about the fairy tales that make them happen.
Some of my crimes are more <unk>
If a woman wants to adopt the last name of her husband, she is her election, and I'm not who to <unk>
If a woman decides to stay at home to raise her children, I accepted that choice, too.
The problem is not that it becomes economically vulnerable through this same choice, the problem is that our society is <unk> in a way that women are economically vulnerable when they <unk>
I put this problem.
<unk> the conventional Feminism that has ignored or diverted historically the needs of women of color, the gay workers, gay workers, <unk> for white, <unk> and <unk> <unk>
<unk> if that's good Feminism I'm a very bad feminist <unk>
It also happens to the following: As a feminist, I feel a lot of pressure.
We have this trend of <unk> <unk> in a <unk>
We hope that it will be perfection.
When we get rid of the <unk> with a lot of taste from the same <unk> where the <unk>
As I said, I am a <unk> I consider myself to stand up with that <unk> before I try to put in there.
<unk> women, particularly the innovative and leaders of the sector, are afraid of being <unk> as <unk>
They are afraid to stand up and say, "Yeah, I'm <unk> by fear of what that really means is that <unk> fear of fear not to be able to play with little expectations like this.
Let's take <unk> or like I call it, <unk>
In the last few years, it's a <unk> <unk>
In the <unk> Music <unk> 2014, in <unk> acted in front of the word <unk> three feet high.
It was a <unk> show, looking at this star star to take openly Feminism and make women and young men who be feminist is something to be proud of.
<unk> the time, the cultural critics started endless arguments if they were or not a feminist.
<unk> their feminism, instead of simply believe the word of an adult and <unk> woman.
<unk> perfection because we're still struggling for much, we want a lot, we need so much <unk>
We're going to go far beyond the sensible criticism and <unk> <unk> Feminism of any woman, <unk> until there was nothing.
We don't need to do that.
<unk> or rather, one more inclusive Feminism is the point of departure.
But what happens next?
We go from recognizing our <unk> to give the action and be a little more brave.
If I hear music <unk> I'm creating a demand for artists that would be more happy providing a <unk> supply.
These artists will not change their way to talk about women in their songs until they <unk> the change actually affecting their profit.
It's certainly hard.
Why does their music be so <unk>
It's hard to choose something better and so easy to justify a worst choice.
But when bad decisions justify this makes it more difficult for women to achieve equality, equality that we all deserve and is our responsibility.
I think of my <unk> three and four years.
It's two <unk> <unk> <unk> and bright and very brave. I want you to grow up in a world.
Where are they getting rid of the strong creatures they are.
I think of them, all of a sudden, the best choice would be <unk> as something much easier to do.
We can all make better decisions.
We can change the channel when a TV program is about sexual violence against women as a sport, <unk> the <unk> <unk>
We can change the radio <unk> when we listen to songs that treat women like nothing.
We can spend our money to go to cinema in another part when movies don't treat women as much as <unk> objects.
We can stop supporting professional sports where athletes treat their companions like <unk>
In any case, men -- especially white men can say, "No, I'm not going to post in your journal to participate in your project, or work with you, until it doesn't include a number of women, so much to participate in how to make decisions.
I'm not going to work with you until your timeline, or your organization is more <unk> with a wider range of people."
Those of us who are <unk> but <unk> to participate in this kind of projects, we can also evolve to become even more as far as competitive beings to be able to overcome barriers to the decision election.
Because we're not <unk> <unk> Without these efforts without embracing these <unk> our achievements are going to mean very little.
We can commit these little acts of bravery and hope that our decisions come to the top, to people in the power or directors of film and music, <unk> <unk> the <unk> the people who can make big decisions, more courageous, to create a lasting and significant change.
We can also say to bravery our life, good, bad or any <unk>
The last line of my book, <unk> <unk> says, <unk> being a bad feminist not to be in <unk>
This is true because of a lot of reasons, but I tell you, most of all, because I knew my voice was <unk> and Feminism helped me <unk>
There was one incident.
I call it incident to cope with what happened.
A few guys told me when I was very young, and I didn't know that kids can do this to a girl.
I was treated like anything.
I started to believe that it was nothing.
<unk> my voice, and after all I did not help me believe that I could say something that might matter.
But I was writing.
And I went back to <unk>
I was getting into a stronger version of myself.
The words of those women who could understand a story like mine, and of women who looked like me and understood what meant to live in this world if you have the brown skin.
The words of women who showed me that was nothing.
I learned how to write like them, and then I learned how to write as myself.
I found my voice, and I started to believe that my voice is powerful beyond what you can measure.
Through writing and feminism, also I found that if I was a little brave, another woman could be <unk> and see me and see that none of us is the nothing that the world is trying to tell us we are.
In one hand, I have the power to achieve anything.
And on the other, I argue that I am just a woman.
I'm a bad feminist, I'm a good woman, I'm trying to improve my way to think, what I do, without abandoning everything that makes me human.
I hope we all can do the same thing.
I hope that we can all be a little courageous, when you need such a courage.
Right after Christmas last year, I spent kids in California had <unk> for being visited or being exposed to someone who had been there.
The virus then went through the border with Canada, <unk> to over 100 children in <unk>
One of the <unk> things about this outbreak is that the <unk> that can be fatal for a child with an immune system -- is one of the most consistent diseases in the world.
There is an effective vaccine against this for over half a century ago, but a lot of the kids involved in the outbreak <unk> had not been vaccinated because their parents were afraid of something allegedly <unk> autism.
But a moment, it was not the article that unleashed the argument about autism and vaccines <unk> disqualified and marked by being a fraud <unk> by the British Medical Organization.
It doesn't believe most intelligent scientists that the theory that vaccines cause autism is a <unk>
I think most of you know, but millions of parents all around the world are still <unk> that vaccines will pay to their children of having autism.
Why?
Here's why.
This is a graph of the increase of autism in time.
For most of the 20th century, autism was considered a very rare disease.
The few psychologists and <unk> that I had heard about it, they create all his professional life without seeing one case.
For decades, the prevalence of prevalence got stable only three or four children for every <unk>
But then, in the 1990s, the numbers started to <unk>
<unk> <unk> as <unk> <unk> are referred to the autism as an epidemic as if I could <unk> another child in <unk>
What's going on?
If it's not vaccines, what is it?
So if you ask people from the Center for Disease Control which is what's going on, they tend to be based on phrases like <unk> of diagnostic diagnostic <unk> and "a better detection of <unk> to explain these <unk> figures.
But that kind of language doesn't <unk> a lot of the fears of a young mother who looks at the face of her two year-old son of visual contact.
If the criteria were they had to figure out, why were they <unk>
Why were the cases of autism so hard to find before the <unk>
Five years ago, I decided to discover the answers to these questions.
I learned that what happened is less than seeing with slow progress and <unk> of science that with the <unk> power of storytelling.
In the most of the 20th century, doctors told a story about what autism is and how it discovered, but that story turned out to be fake, and the consequences of the same is having a devastating impact on global public health.
There was a second more accurate story of autism that had lost and forgotten in the dark corner of the clinical literature.
This second story tells us all about how we get here and where we need to go.
The first story begins with an infant psychiatrist Leo <unk> at Johns Hopkins <unk> at Johns Hopkins wrote an article that describes 11 young patients who seemed <unk> private worlds, <unk> the people around them, even their own parents.
They could amuse them, for hours by waving their hands on their faces, but they were prey to panic.
On the basis of patients treated in their clinic, <unk> <unk> that autism is very rare.
For the 1950s, as the main authority of the world on the subject, stated that I had seen less than 150 true cases of their syndrome as we <unk> it from places as far as South Africa.
This is really not surprisingly, because the criteria of <unk> for autism diagnosis were very <unk>
For example, we will give you that diagnosis to children with seizures but now we know that epilepsy is very common in autism.
Once it was <unk> that he had become nine from every 10 kids sent out for other doctors to their office to be autistic without giving a diagnosis of autism.
<unk> was a smart man, but part of his theories were not <unk>
<unk> autism as a form of <unk> child caused by cold parents.
These kids, he said, you have kept on a fridge on a fridge not <unk>
At the same time, though, I noticed that some of his young patients had special skills that cluster in certain areas like music, mathematics and memory.
One of the kids in their clinic might distinguish between 18 <unk> before I turned the two years.
When her mother put one of his favorite records he correctly said, <unk>
But <unk> had a bad opinion of these skills, stating things like the kids were just <unk> what they had heard their parents <unk> desperate to earn their approval.
As a result, autism became a source of shame for families, and two generations of autistic children were sent to institutions for their own well, becoming invisible to the world in general.
Amazingly, it was not until the 1970s, that researchers started to test the <unk> theory of autism was weird.
<unk> <unk> a cognitive psychologist in London, thought the theory of mothers who were <unk> was pretty stupid.
She and her husband John was warm and <unk> and they had a deep autistic daughter called <unk>
<unk> and John knew how hard it was to raise as a child as Silver <unk> without special education, and without access to other resources without a diagnosis.
To defend in the front of the National Health Service, they needed more resources for autistic children and their families, <unk> and their colleague Judith Gould decided to do something that should be spent 30 years before.
They launched a prevalence of autism in the general population.
It was a suburb of London called <unk> to try to find the kids autistic kids in the community.
What you saw -- I left clear that the <unk> model was too limited, because the reality of autism was much more colorful and diverse and diverse and diverse and diverse in autism.
Some children could not speak at all, whereas others were <unk> in their fascination by astrophysics, in the dinosaurs or in the <unk> of <unk>
Otherwise these children don't <unk> in nice and <unk> and <unk> said <unk> and saw a lot of them, much more than the <unk> model of <unk> would have predicted.
At first, they were lost for trying to make sense of their data.
How no one had no noticed of these children before?
But then <unk> I found a reference to an article that was published in German in <unk> the next year of <unk> and then <unk> buried under the cinders of a terrible time that nobody wanted to remember.
<unk> I knew about this article of competition, but he avoided <unk> <unk> in his own work.
Not even one translation in the English, but luckily, the husband of <unk> speak German, and he was translated it for her.
The document offers an alternative story of autism.
His author was a man named Hans disease, which I ran a clinic integrated with a school school in Vienna, in the 1930s.
The ideas of Asperger's for teaching children are <unk> even for the <unk> standards.
The morning in their clinic started with music exercises with music, and the kids followed their games for the afternoon.
Instead of blaming the parents of causing autism, Asperger's as as disability as a <unk> disability of life that required ways of support and <unk> spaces for the course of all life.
Instead of dealing with children in their clinic as patients, Asperger's called them their little teachers, and he went to help in the developing methods of education that were particularly suited to them.
And basically, Asperger's saw autism as a diverse set of diverse <unk> and disability.
He believed that autism and autistic traits were common and always have been, looking at aspects of this continuum in <unk> known in the pop culture like awkward social scientist and Professor <unk>
He was beyond even to say that for success in science and art, an ounce of autism is critical.
<unk> and Judith found that <unk> was wrong in that autism was <unk> as well as the parents were <unk>
Over the next few years, they worked in silence with the American Association of <unk> to extend the criteria of diagnosis that reflect the diversity of what they called <unk> <unk>
By the end of the 1980s and principles of the '90s, their changes in <unk> in <unk> by using the limited model of <unk> by one wider and unprecedented model.
These changes not fell into broken bag.
<unk> when <unk> and Judith worked between <unk> these people all over the world would see an autistic adult for the first time.
Before I came out <unk> <unk> in 1988, just a little circle, <unk> by experts knew what autism, but after the <unk> performance of <unk> <unk> as <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> with four awards from <unk> <unk> psychologists, teachers and parents from everybody knew what was autism.
At the same time, they introduced the first easy clinical trials to use to diagnose autism.
I shouldn't have a connection with that little circle of experts to get a diagnosis for her son.
The combination of <unk> <unk> the changes in the criteria and the introduction of these tests created a network, a perfect storm of consciousness of autism.
The number of diagnoses started to <unk> the same as they predicted <unk> and <unk> in fact that they were waiting for the way out, making people with autism and their families finally get the support and services that were <unk>
So Andrew <unk> came to blame vaccines for the rise of the <unk> a simple, powerful, credible story as bad as the <unk> theory of autism was <unk>
If the estimate of the prevention of the prevention of the prevention of one of every 68 children in the United States are in the spectrum, it's right, the autistic groups are one of the world's largest <unk> groups.
In the last few years, people autistic people have joined the Internet to reject the idea that they are the puzzles to solve the new doctors, the <unk> the term <unk> to celebrate the varieties of human cognition.
One way to understand <unk> is to think about terms of human operating systems.
The fact that a PC doesn't work with Windows doesn't mean it's cut.
According to the <unk> standards, the normal human brain is easily <unk> <unk> social, and it's a attention deficit to details.
Surely, people autistic people have a struggle to live in a world not built for them.
70 years later, we're still reaching disease, which creates that <unk> for the most effective aspects of autism are found in the understanding of teachers, employers with capacity, communities of support, and parents with faith in the potential of their children.
A autistic woman named <unk> <unk> once said, "We need all the hands on covered to <unk> the boat of the <unk>
As we went into an uncertain future, we need all the forms of human intelligence on the planet to address the challenges that we face as society.
We can't afford to waste wasting a brain.
Thank you.
